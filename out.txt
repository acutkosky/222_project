for

to
most
inhabitants
in
by
reason
of
the
conquest
that
there
the
grecians
had
as
also
by
the
which
thither
they
had
for
the
same
causes
also
it
was
well
understood
in
many
places
of
and
of
africa
therefore
the
word
of
being
set
forth
in
becometh
hereby
like
a
candle
set
upon
a
which
giveth
light
to
all
that
are
in
the
or
like
a
proclamation
sounded
forth
in
the
market
which
most
men
presently
take
knowledge
and
therefore
that
language
was
fittest
to
contain
the
both
for
the
first
preachers
of
the
gospel
to
appeal
unto
for
and
for
the
learners
also
of
those
times
to
make
search
and
trial
it
is
that
that
translation
was
not
so
sound
and
so
but
it
needed
in
many
places
and
who
had
been
so
sufficient
for
this
work
as
the
apostles
or
apostolic
yet
it
seemed
good
to
the
holy
ghost
and
to
to
take
that
which
they
found
same
being
for
the
greatest
part
true
and
rather
than
making
a
in
that
new
world
and
green
age
of
the
expose
themselves
to
many
exceptions
and
as
though
they
made
a
translation
to
serve
their
own
and
therefore
bearing
a
witness
to
their
witness
not
to
be
this
may
be
supposed
to
be
some
cause
why
the
translation
of
the
seventy
was
allowed
to
pass
for
though
it
was
commended
yet
it
did
not
fully
content
the
not
of
the
for
not
long
after
aquila
fell
in
hand
with
a
new
and
after
him
and
after
him
there
was
a
fifth
and
a
sixth
the
authors
whereof
were
not
these
with
the
seventy
made
up
the
and
were
worthily
and
to
great
purpose
compiled
together
by
howbeit
the
edition
of
the
seventy
went
away
with
the
and
therefore
not
only
was
placed
in
the
midst
by
origen
the
worth
and
excellency
thereof
above
the
as
epiphanius
but
also
was
used
by
the
greek
fathers
for
the
ground
and
foundation
of
their
epiphanius
above
named
doth
attribute
so
much
unto
that
he
holdeth
the
authors
thereof
not
only
for
but
also
for
prophets
in
some
and
justinian
the
enjoining
the
jews
his
subjects
to
use
specially
the
translation
of
the
rendereth
this
reason
because
they
were
as
it
were
enlightened
with
prophetical
yet
for
all
as
the
egyptians
are
said
of
the
prophet
to
be
men
and
not
and
their
horses
flesh
and
not
spirit
so
it
is
evident
jerome
affirmeth
as
that
the
seventy
were
they
were
not
they
did
many
things
as
learned
but
yet
as
men
they
stumbled
and
one
while
through
another
while
through
sometimes
they
may
be
noted
to
add
to
the
and
sometimes
to
take
from
which
made
the
apostles
to
leave
them
many
when
they
left
the
and
to
deliver
the
sense
thereof
according
to
the
truth
of
the
as
the
spirit
gave
them
this
may
suffice
touching
the
greek
translations
of
the
old
translation
out
of
hebrew
and
greek
into
latin
there
were
within
a
few
hundred
years
after
translations
many
into
the
latin
for
this
tongue
also
was
very
fit
to
convey
the
law
and
the
gospel
because
in
those
times
very
many
countries
of
the
yea
of
the
east
and
spake
or
understood
being
made
provinces
to
the
but
now
the
latin
translations
were
too
many
to
be
all
for
they
were
infinite
interpretes
nullo
modo
numerari
saith
again
they
were
not
out
of
the
hebrew
fountain
speak
of
the
latin
translations
of
the
old
but
out
of
the
greek
the
greek
being
not
altogether
the
latin
derived
from
it
must
needs
be
this
moved
most
learned
and
the
best
linguist
without
controversy
of
his
age
or
of
any
that
went
before
undertake
the
translating
of
the
old
out
of
the
very
fountains
which
he
performed
with
that
evidence
of
great
and
that
he
hath
forever
bound
the
church
unto
him
in
a
debt
of
special
remembrance
and
the
translating
of
the
scripture
into
the
vulgar
tongues
now
though
the
church
were
thus
furnished
with
greek
and
latin
even
before
the
faith
of
christ
was
generally
embraced
in
the
empire
the
learned
know
that
even
in
the
consul
of
rome
and
his
wife
were
both
and
about
the
same
time
the
greatest
part
of
the
senate
yet
for
all
that
the
were
not
content
to
have
the
scriptures
in
the
language
which
they
themselves
greek
and
latin
the
good
lepers
were
not
content
to
fare
well
but
acquainted
their
neighbors
with
the
store
that
god
had
that
they
also
might
provide
for
but
also
for
the
behoof
and
edifying
of
the
unlearned
which
hungered
and
thirsted
after
and
had
souls
to
be
saved
as
well
as
they
provided
translations
into
the
vulgar
for
their
insomuch
that
most
nations
under
heaven
did
shortly
after
their
hear
christ
speaking
unto
them
in
their
mother
not
by
the
voice
of
their
minister
but
also
by
the
written
word
if
any
doubt
he
may
be
satisfied
by
examples
if
enough
will
serve
the
jerome
multarum
gentium
linguis
scriptura
ante
docet
falsa
esse
quae
addita
scripture
being
translated
before
in
the
languages
of
many
doth
show
that
those
things
that
were
added
lucian
and
are
so
jerome
in
that
the
same
jerome
elsewhere
affirmeth
that
the
time
had
set
forth
the
translation
of
the
seventy
suae
linguae
for
his
countrymen
of
dalmatia
which
words
not
only
erasmus
doth
understand
to
that
jerome
translated
the
scripture
into
the
dalmatian
but
also
sixtus
and
alphonsus
castro
we
speak
of
no
men
not
to
be
excepted
against
by
them

ingenuously

so

infinite
other

be
added

full
of
these

the

the
hebrew
is
turned
not
only
into
the
language
of
the
but
also
of
the
and
and
and
and
and
and
and
briefly
into
all
the
languages
that
any
nation
so
in
like
ulpilas
is
reported
by
paulus
diaconus
and
isidor
before
them
by
to
have
translated
the
scriptures
into
the
gothic
bishop
of
by
vasseus
to
have
turned
them
into
about
the
year
of
our
lord
beda
by
to
have
turned
a
great
part
of
them
into
efnard
by
to
have
abridged
the
french
as
beda
had
done
the
about
the
year
king
alfred
by
the
said
to
have
turned
the
psalter
into
saxon
methodius
by
aventinus
at
to
have
turned
the
scriptures
into
slavonian
bishop
of
by
beatus
rhenanus
to
have
caused
about
that
time
the
gospels
to
be
translated
into
dutch
yet
extant
in
the
library
of
corbinian
by
divers
to
have
turned
them
himself
or
to
have
gotten
them
turned
into
about
the
year
charles
the
fifth
of
that
surnamed
the
to
have
caused
them
to
be
turned
into
about
years
after
valdus
his
of
which
translation
there
be
many
copies
yet
as
witnesseth
much
about
that
even
in
our
king
richard
the
john
trevisa
translated
them
into
and
many
english
bibles
in
written
hand
are
yet
to
be
seen
with
as
it
is
very
in
that
so
the
syrian
translation
of
the
new
testament
is
in
most
learned
libraries
of
widminstadius
his
setting
and
the
psalter
in
arabic
is
with
many
of
augustinus
setting
so
postel
that
in
his
travel
he
saw
the
gospels
in
the
ethiopian
and
ambrose
thesius
allegeth
the
psalter
of
the
which
he
testifieth
to
have
been
set
forth
by
potken
in
syrian
so
that
to
have
the
scriptures
in
the
mother
tongue
is
not
a
quaint
conceit
lately
taken
either
by
the
lord
cromwell
in
or
by
the
lord
radevile
in
or
by
the
lord
ungnadius
in
the
but
hath
been
thought
upon
and
put
in
practice
of
even
from
the
first
times
of
the
conversion
of
any
no
doubt
because
it
was
esteemed
most
to
cause
faith
to
grow
in
hearts
the
and
to
make
them
to
be
able
to
say
with
the
words
of
the
we
have
so
we
have
the
unwillingness
of
our
chief
adversaries
that
the
scriptures
should
be
divulged
in
the
mother
now
the
church
of
rome
would
seem
at
the
length
to
bear
a
motherly
affection
towards
her
and
to
allow
them
the
scriptures
in
their
mother
but
indeed
it
is
a
not
deserving
to
be
called
a
unprofitable
gift
they
must
first
get
a
license
in
writing
before
they
may
use
and
to
get
they
must
approve
themselves
to
their
to
be
such
as
if
not
frozen
in
the
yet
soured
with
the
leaven
of
their
it
seemed
too
much
to
clement
the
eighth
that
there
should
be
any
license
granted
to
have
them
in
the
vulgar
and
therefore
he
overruleth
and
frustrateth
the
grant
of
pius
the
so
much
are
they
afraid
of
the
light
of
the
scripture
as
tertullian
that
they
will
not
trust
the
people
with
not
as
it
is
set
forth
by
their
own
sworn
not
with
the
license
of
their
own
bishops
and
so
unwilling
they
are
to
communicate
the
scriptures
to
the
understanding
in
any
that
they
are
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
we
forced
them
to
translate
it
into
english
against
their
this
seemeth
to
argue
a
bad
or
a
bad
or
sure
we
that
it
is
not
he
that
hath
good
that
is
afraid
to
bring
it
to
the
but
he
that
hath
the
neither
is
it
the
true
man
that
shunneth
the
but
the
lest
his
deeds
should
be
reproved
neither
is
it
the
merchant
that
is
unwilling
to
have
the
or
the
meteyard
brought
in
but
he
that
useth
but
we
will
let
them
alone
for
this
and
return
to
the
speeches
and
both
of
our
brethren
and
of
our
against
this
work
many
mouths
have
been
open
a
good
while
yet
are
not
with
speeches
about
the
translation
so
long
in
or
rather
perusals
of
translations
made
and
ask
what
may
be
the
what
the
necessity
of
the
hath
the
church
been
say
all
this
hath
her
sweet
bread
been
mingled
with
here
silver
with
her
wine
with
her
milk
with
gypsum
male
saith
we
hoped
that
we
had
been
in
the
right
that
we
had
had
the
oracles
of
god
delivered
unto
and
that
though
all
the
world
had
cause
to
be
offended
and
to
yet
that
we
had
hath
the
nurse
holden
out
the
and
nothing
but
wind
in
hath
the
bread
been
delivered
by
the
fathers
of
the
and
the
same
proved
to
be
as
seneca
what
is
it
to
handle
the
word
of
god
if
this
be
thus
certain
also
the
adversaries
of
judah
and
like
sanballat
in
as
we
both
the
work
and
the
do
these
weak
will
they
make
the
stones
whole
again
out
of
the
heaps
of
dust
which
are
although
they
yet
if
a
fox
go
he
shall
even
break
down
their
stony
their
translation
good
why
do
they
now
mend
was
it
not
why
then
was
it
obtruded
to
the
why
did
the
catholics
popish
always
go
in
for
refusing
to
go
to
hear
if
it
must
be
translated
into
catholics
are
fittest
to
do
they
have
and
they
know
when
a
thing
is
they
can
manum

we
will
answer
them
both
and
the
being
with
damnamus

that
we
condemn
the

after
the

pains
we
can

whether
my

that
which
was
in
thus
jerome
may
be
thought
to
a
satisfaction
to
our
brethren
and
to
the
same
effect
say
that
we
are
so
far
off
from
condemning
any
of
their
labors
that
travailed
before
us
in

either
in

we
acknowledge
them
to
have
been
raised
up

the

that
they

in

the

of

timotheus
had

if

therefore
blessed

most
honoured
be
their
that
break

which
helpeth
forward
to
the

of

what
can
be
more
available

to
deliver

unto
people
in

tongue
is
strange
unto
yet
for
all
as
nothing
is
begun

perfected
at
the

and
the

to

no

thank
the

of

the
gleaning
of

of
ephraim

not

judges
joash
the
king
of
israel
did
not
satisfy
himself
till
he
had
smitten
the
ground
three
and
yet
he
offended
the
for
giving
over
of
whom
we
spake
translated
the
bible
as
carefully
and
as
skillfully
as
he
and
yet
he
thought
good
to
go
over
it
and
then
it
got
the
credit
with
the
to
be
called
kata
that
as
jerome
how
many
books
of
profane
learning
have
been
gone
over
again
and
again
by
the
same
by
of
one
and
the
same
book
of
there
are
extant
not
so
few
as
six
or
seven
several
now
if
this
cost
may
be
bestowed
upon
the
which
affordeth
us
a
little

which
today

tomorrow
is

what

we
what

we
not
to
the
the
fruit
whereof

glad
the
conscience
of

the
stem
whereof

this

the
word
of

we

tanti
quanti
verum
saith
tertullian
a
toy
of

reckoning
with
how
ought
we
to

therefore
let
no
eye

his

neither
let
any
be
that
we
have
a
prince
that
seeketh
the
increase
of
the
spiritual
wealth
of
sanballats
and
tobiahs
do
which
therefore
do
bear
their
just
but
let
us
rather
bless
god
from
the
ground
of
our
for
working
this
religious
care
in
to
have
the
translations
of
the
bible
maturely
considered
of

for
by
this

it
cometh
to
that
whatsoever

sound
already
all
is
sound
for

other
of

the
worst
of
ours
far
better

if
anything

not
so
agreeable

what
can
the
king
command
to

that
will
bring
him
more
true
honour

wherein
could
they
that

approve
their
duty
to
the
their
obedience
to

love
to
his

by
yielding
their
and
all
that
is
within
for
the
furnishing
of
the

besides
all
they
were
the
principal
motives
of
and
therefore
ought
least
to
quarrel
for
the
very
historical
truth
that
upon
the
importunate
petitions
of
the
at
his
coming
to
this
the
conference
at
hampton
court
having
been
appointed
for
hearing
their
when
by
force
of
reason
they
were
put
from
all
other
they
had
recourse
at
the
to
this
that
they
could
not
with
good
conscience
subscribe
to
the
communion
since
it
maintained
the
bible
as
it
was
there
which
was
they
a
most
corrupted
and
although
this
was
judged
to
be
but
a
very
poor
and
empty
yet
even
hereupon
did
his
majesty
begin
to
bethink
himself
of
the
good
that
might
ensue
by
a
new
and
presently
after
gave
order
for
this
translation
which
is
now
presented
unto
thus
much
to
satisfy
our
scrupulous
an
answer
to
the
imputations
of
our
adversaries
now
to
the
latter
we
answer
that
we
do
not
we
affirm
and
the
very
meanest
translation
of
the
bible
in
set
forth
by
men
of
our
we
have
seen
none
of
theirs
of
the
whole
bible
as
containeth
the
word
of

the
word
of

the
which
he
uttered
in
being
translated
into
and
is
still
the
though
it
be
not
interpreted
by
every
translator
with
the
like
nor
peradventure
so
fitly
for
nor
so
expressly
for

it
is
confessed
that
things
are
to
take
their
denomination
of
the
greater

a
natural
man

verum

may
be
counted
a
virtuous
though
he
have
made
many
slips
in

were
none
for

many
things
we
offend
also
a
comely
man
and
though
he
have
some
warts
upon
his
not
only
freckles
upon
his
but
also
no
cause
therefore
why
the
word
translated
should
be
denied
to

forbidden

that
some
imperfections
and
blemishes
may
be
noted
in
the
setting
forth
of

whatever
was
perfect

apostles
or
apostolic
men
endued
with
an
extraordinary
measure
of
and
privileged
with
the
privilege
of
not

the
romanists
in
refusing
to
and
daring
to
burn
the
word
did
no
less
than
despite
the
spirit
of
from
whom
originally
it
and
whose
sense
and
as
well
as
weakness
would
it
did
judge
by
an
example
or
plutarch
that
after
that
rome
had
been
burnt
by
the
they
fell
soon
to
build
it
but
doing
it
in
they
did
not
cast
the
nor
proportion
the
houses
in
such
comely
as
had
been
most
sightly
and
was
catiline
therefore
an
honest
or
a
good
that
sought
to
bring
it
to
a
or
nero
a
good
that
did
indeed
set
it
on
so
by
the
story
of
ezra
and
the
prophecy
of
haggai
it
may
be
that
the
temple
built
by
zerubbabel
after
the
return
from

by
no
means
to
be
compared
to
the
former
built
by
solomon

that
remembered
the
former
wept
when
they
considered
the

this
latter
either
have
been
abhorred
and
forsaken
by
the
or
profaned
by
the
the
like
we
are
to
think
of
the
translation
of
the
seventy
dissenteth
from
the
original
in
many
neither
doth
it
come
near
for

which
of
the

commend

it
had
been
unworthy

they
urge
for
their
second
defence
of
their
vilifying
and
abusing
of

some
pieces
thereof

they
meet
for

they

before
we
we
must
answer
a
third
cavil
and
objection
of
theirs
against
for
altering

amending

wherein
truly

hardly
and
strangely

this

to
the

that
of
all

ought

silent

what
varieties

what

also
of

is
to
be
seen
in
a
his
preface

out

the
more
ancient
books

brought
into
use
the
missals
of
the
friars
and
commanded
them
to
be
observed
insomuch
that
about
an
hundred
years
when
the
radulphus
happened
to
be
at

found
all
the
books
to
be
new
the
new
neither
were
there
this
chopping
and
changing
in
the
more
ancient
times
but
also
of
pius
quintus
himself
that
every
bishopric
almost
had
a
peculiar
kind
of
most
unlike
to
that
which
others
which
moved
him
to
abolish
all
other
though
never
so
and
privileged
and
published
by
bishops
in
their
and
to
establish
and
ratify
that
only
which
was
of
his
own
setting
in
the
year
now
when
the
father
of
their

gladly
would
heal
the
sore
of
the
daughter
of
his
people
softly
and
slightly
and
make
the
best
of
findeth
so
great
fault
with
them
for
their
odds
and
we
hope
the
children
have
no
great
cause
to
vaunt
of
their
but
the
difference
that
appeareth
between
our
and
our
often
correcting
of
is
the
thing
that
we
are
specially
charged
let
us
see
therefore
whether
they
themselves
be
without
fault
this
way
it
be
to
be
counted
a
to
and
whether
they
be
fit
men
to
throw
stones
at
o
tandem
major
parcas
insane
that
are
less
sound
ought
not
to
object
infirmities
to
if
we
should
tell
them
that
and
vives
found
fault
with
their
vulgar
and
consequently
wished
the
same
to
be
or
a
new
one
to
be
they
would
answer
that
we
produced
their
enemies
for
witnesses
against
they
were
in
no
other
sort
enemies
than
as
paul
was
to
the
for
telling
them
the

it
were
to
be
wished
that
they
had
dared
to
tell
it
them
plainlier
and
but
what
will
they
say
to
that
pope
leo
the
tenth
allowed
translation
of
the
new
so
much
different
from
the
by
his
apostolic
letter

that
the

leo
exhorted
pagnin
to
translate
the
whole

bare
whatsoever

necessary

the
apostle
reasoneth
to

been

had
been
no
need
of
the
so
we
may
that
if
the
old
vulgar
had
been
at
all
points
to
small
purpose
had
labour
and
charges
been
about
framing
of
a

they
it
was
one
private
and
that
he
consulted
only
then
we
are
able
to
go
further
with
and
to
aver
that
more
of
their
chief
men
of
all
even
their
own
trent
champions
paiva
and
and
their
own
hieronymus
ab

their
own
bishop
isidorus
and
their
own
cardinal
thomas
a
vio
do
either
make
new
translations
or
follow
new
ones
of
other
or
note
the
vulgar
interpreter
for
none
of
them
fear
to
dissent
from
nor
yet
to
except
against
and
call
they
this
an
uniform
tenor
of
text
and
judgment
about
the
so
many
of
their
worthies
disclaiming
the
now
received
we
will
yet
come
nearer
the
doth
not
their
paris
edition
differ
from
the
and
hentenius
his
from
them
and
yet
all
of
them
allowed
by
doth
not
sixtus
quintus
that
certain
catholics
meaneth
certain
of
his
own
were
in
such
an
humor
of
translating
the
scriptures
into
that
satan
taking
occasion
by
though
they
thought
of
no
such
did
strive
what
he
out
of
so
uncertain
and
manifold
a
variety
of
so
to
mingle
all
things
that
nothing
might
seem
to
be
left
certain
and
firm
in
did
not
the
same
sixtus
ordain
by
an
inviolable
and
that
with
the
counsel
and
consent
of
his
that
the
latin
edition
of
the
old
and
new
which
the
council
of
trent
would
have
to
be
is
the
same
without
controversy
which
he
then
set
being
diligently
corrected
and
printed
in
the
printing
house
of
thus
sixtus
in
his
preface
before
his
and
yet
clement
the
his
immediate
published
another
edition
of
the
containing
in
it
infinite
differences
from
that
of
sixtus
many
of
them
weighty
and
and
yet
this
must
be
authentic
by
all
what
is
to
have
the
faith
of
our
glorious
lord
jesus
christ
with
and
if
this
be
what
is
sweet
harmony
and
if
this
as
demaratus
of
corinth
advised
a
great
before
he
talked
of
the
dissensions
among
the
to
compose
his
domestic
broils
at
that
time
his
queen
and
his
son
and
heir
were
at
deadly
feud
with
so
all
the
while
that
our
adversaries
do
make
so
many
and
so
various
editions
and
do
jar
so
much
about
the
worth
and
authority
of
they
can
with
no
show
of
equity
challenge
us
for
changing
and
the
purpose
of
the
translators
with
their
but
it
is
high
time
to
leave
and
to
show
in
brief
what
we
proposed
to
and
what
course
we
held
in
this
our
perusal
and
survey
of
the
good
christian
we
never
thought
from
the
that
we
should
need
to
make
a
new
nor
yet
to
make
of
a
bad
one
a
good
one
then
the
imputation
of
sixtus
had
been
true
in
some
that
our
people
had
been
fed
with
gall
of
dragons
instead
of
with
whey
instead
of
but
to
make
a
good
one
or
out
of
many
good
one
principal
good
not
justly
to
be
excepted
that
hath
been
our
that
our
to
that
there
were
many
chosen
that
were
greater
in
other
eyes
than
in
their
and
that
sought
the
truth
rather
than
their
own
they
came
or
were
thought
to
come
to
the
not
exercendi
causa
one
but
that
not
to
for
the
chief
overseer
and
ergodiwkthv
under
his
to
whom
not
only
but
also
our
whole
church
was
much
knew
by
his
which
thing
also
nazianzen
taught
so
long
that
it
is
a
preposterous
order
to
teach
first
and
to
learn
yea
that
to
en
piqw
keramian
learn
and
practice
is
neither
commendable
for
the
nor
safe
for
the
therefore
such
were
thought
upon
as
could
say
modestly
with
et
hebreaeum
sermonem
ex
parte
et
in
latino
pene
ab
ipsis
detriti
we
have
learned
the
hebrew
tongue
in
and
in
the
latin
we
have
been
exercised
almost
from
our
very
jerome
maketh
no
mention
of
the
greek
wherein
yet
he
did
because
he
translated
not
the
old
testament
out
of
but
out
of
and
in
what
sort
did
these
in
the
trust
of
their
own
or
of
their
sharpness
of
or
deepness
of
as
it
were
in
an
arm
of
at
no
they
trusted
in
him
that
hath
the
key
of
opening
and
no
man
they
prayed
to
the
the
father
of
our
to
the
effect
that
augustine
let
thy
scriptures
be
my
pure
scriptures
be
my
pure
let
me
not
be
deceived
in
neither
let
me
deceive
by
in
this
confidence
and
with
this
devotion
did
they
assemble
not
too
lest
one
should
trouble
and
yet
lest
many
things
haply
might
escape
if
you
ask
what
they
had
before
truly
it
was
the
hebrew
text
of
the
old
the
greek
of
the
these
are
the
two
golden
or
rather
wherethrough
the
olive
branches
empty
themselves
into
the
augustine
calleth
them
or
original
tongues
the
same
jerome
and
gratian
hath
not
spared
to
put
it
into
his
that
the
credit
of
the
old
books
meaneth
of
the
old
is
to
be
tried
by
the
hebrew
so
of
the
new
by
the
greek
tongue
meaneth
by
the
original
if
truth
be
tried
by
these
then
whence
should
a
translation
be
but
out
of
these
tongues
we
in
those
set
before
us
to
being
the
tongues
wherein
god
was
pleased
to
speak
to
his
church
by
his
prophets
and
neither
did
we
run
over
the
work
with
that
posting
haste
that
the
septuagint
if
that
be
true
which
is
reported
of
that
they
finished
it
in
days
neither
were
we
barred
or
hindered
from
going
over
it
having
once
done
like
that
be
true
which
himself
that
he
could
no
sooner
write
anything
but
presently
it
was
caught
from
him
and
and
he
could
not
have
leave
to
mend
it
to
be
were
we
the
first
that
fell
in
hand
with
translating
the
scripture
into
and
consequently
destitute
of
former
as
it
is
written
of
that
he
was
the
first
in
a
manner
that
put
his
hand
to
write
commentaries
upon
the
and
therefore
no
if
he
overshot
himself
many
none
of
these
the
work
hath
not
been
huddled
up
in
but
hath
cost
the
as
light
as
it
the
pains
of
twice
seven
times
days
and
matters
of
such
weight
and
consequence
are
to
be
speeded
with
for
in
a
business
of
moment
a
man
feareth
not
the
blame
of
convenient
neither
did
we
think
much
to
consult
the
translators
or
greek
or
nor
the
or
neither
did
we
disdain
to
revise
that
which
we
had
and
to
bring
back
to
the
anvil
that
which
we
had
but
having
and
using
as
great
helps
as
were
and
fearing
no
reproach
for
nor
coveting
praise
for
we
have
at
through
the
good
hand
of
the
lord
upon
brought
the
work
to
that
pass
that
you
reasons
moving
us
to
set
diversity
of
senses
in
the
where
there
is
great
probability
for
each
some
peradventure
would
have
no
variety
of
senses
to
be
set
in
the
lest
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
for
deciding
of
controversies
by
that
show
of
uncertainty
should
somewhat
be
but
we
hold
their
judgment
not
to
be
so
sound
in
this
for
though
things
are
necessary
are
as
chrysostom
and
as
those
things
that
are
plainly
set
down
in
the
all
such
matters
are
found
that
concern
and
yet
for
all
that
it
cannot
be
that
partly
to
exercise
and
whet
our
partly
to
wean
the
curious
from
the
loathing
of
them
for
their

scatter
words

been

in
matters
of

is
better
to
make
doubt
of
those
things
which
are

to
strive
about
those
things
that
are
there
be
many
words
in
the
scriptures
which
be
never
found
there
but
once
neither
brother
nor
as
the
hebrews
so
that
we
cannot
be
holpen
by
conference
of
there
be
many
rare
names
of
certain
beasts
and
precious
concerning
which
the
hebrews
themselves
are
so
divided
among
themselves
for
that
they
may
seem
to
have
defined
this
or
that
rather
because
they
would
say
something
than
because
they
were
sure
of
that
which
they
as
jerome
somewhere
saith
of

in
such
a

not
a
margin
do
well
to
admonish
the
reader
to
seek
and
not
to
conclude
or
dogmatize
upon
this
or
that
for
as
it
is
a
fault
of
to
doubt
of
those
things
that
are
so
to
determine
of
such
things
as
the
spirit
of
god
hath
left
in
the
judgment
of
the
can
be
no
less
than
therefore
as
augustine
that
variety
of
translations
is
profitable
for
the
finding
out
of
the
sense
of
the
scriptures
so
diversity
of
signification
and
sense
in
the
where
the
text
is
not
so
must
needs
do
is
as
we
are
we
know
that
sixtus
quintus
expressly
forbiddeth
that
any
variety
of
readings
of
their
vulgar
edition
should
be
put
in
the
margin
though
it
be
not
altogether
the
same
thing
to
that
we
have
in
yet
it
looketh
that
but
we
think
he
hath
not
all
of
his
own
side
his
favorers
for
this
they
that
are
wise
had
rather
have
their
judgments
at
liberty
in
differences
of
than
to
be
captivated
to
when
it
may
be
the
if
they
were
sure
that
their
high
priest
had
all
laws
shut
up
in
his
as
paul
the
second
and
that
he
were
as
free
from
error
by
special
privilege
as
the
dictators
of
rome
were
made
by
law
it
were
another
then
his
word
were
an
his
opinion
a
but
the
eyes
of
the
world
are
now
god
be
and
have
been
a
great
they
find
that
he
is
subject
to
the
same
affections
and
infirmities
that
others
that
his
skin
is
and
therefore
so
much
as
he
not
as
much
as
he
they
grant
and
reasons
inducing
us
not
to
stand
curiously
upon
an
identity
of
phrasing
another
thing
we
think
good
to
admonish
thee
gentle
that
we
have
not
tied
ourselves
to
an
uniformity
of
or
to
an
identity
of
as
some
peradventure
would
wish
that
we
had
because
they
observe
that
some
learned
men
somewhere
have
been
as
exact
as
they
could
that
that
we
might
not
vary
from
the
sense
of
that
which
we
had
translated
if
the
word
signified
the
same
thing
in
both
places
there
be
some
words
that
be
not
of
the
same
sense
we
were
especially
and
made
a
conscience
according
to
our
but
that
we
should
express
the
same
notion
in
the
same
particular
as
for
if
we
translate
the
hebrew
or
greek
word
once
by
never
to
call
it
if
one
where
never
if
one
where
never
if
one
where
never
if
one
where
never
to
mince
the
we
thought
to
savor
more
of
curiosity
than
and
that
rather
it
would
breed
scorn
in
the
atheist
than
bring
profit
to
the
godly
for
is
the
kingdom
of
god
become
words
or
why
should
we
be
in
bondage
to
them
if
we
may
be
use
one
precisely
when
we
may
use
another
no
less
as
a
godly
father
in
the
primitive
time
showed
himself
greatly
that
one
of
newfangleness
called
though
the
difference
be
little
or
and
another
reporteth
that
he
was
much
abused
for
turning
which
reading
the
people
had
been
into
now
if
this
happen
in
better
and
upon
so
small
we
might
justly
fear
hard
if
generally
we
should
make
verbal
and
unnecessary
we
might
also
be
charged
with
some
unequal
dealing
towards
a
great
number
of
good
english
for
as
it
is
written
of
a
certain
great
that
he
should
that
those
logs
were
happy
that
were
made
images
to
be
for
their
as
good
as
lay
for
blocks
behind
the
so
if
we
should
as
it
unto
certain
up
have
a
place
in
the
bible
and
to
others
of
like
ye
be
banished
we
might
be
taxed
peradventure
with
james
his
be
partial
in
and
judges
of
evil
add
that
niceness
in
words
was
always
counted
the
next
step
to
and
so
was
to
be
curious
about
that
we
cannot
follow
a
better
pattern
for
elocution
than
god
he
using
divers
in
his
holy
and
indifferently
for
one
thing
in
if
we
will
not
be
may
use
the
same
liberty
in
our
english
versions
out
of
hebrew
and
for
that
copy
or
store
that
he
hath
given
we
have
on
the
one
side
avoided
the
scrupulosity
of
the
who
leave
the
old
ecclesiastical
words
and
betake
them
to
as
when
they
put
washing
for
and
congregation
instead
of
as
also
on
the
other
side
we
have
shunned
the
obscurity
of
the

their
and
a
number
of
such
whereof
their
late
translation
is
that
of
purpose
to
darken
the
that
since
they
must
needs
translate
the
yet
by
the
language
it
may
be
kept
from
being
but
we
desire
that
the
scripture
may
speak
like
as
in
the
language
of
that
it
may
be
understood
even
of
the
very
many
other
things
we
might
give
thee
warning
gentle
if
we
had
not
exceeded
the
measure
of
a
preface
it
remaineth
that
we
commend
thee
to
and
to
the
spirit
of
his
which
is
able
to
build
further
than
we
can
ask
or
he
removeth
the
scales
from
our

veil
from
our
opening
our
wits

we
may
understand

of

through
jesus
christ
our
great
and
manifold
were
the
most
dread
which
almighty
the
father
of
all
bestowed
upon
us
the
people
of
when
first
he
sent
your
royal
person
to
rule
and
reign
over
for
whereas
it
was
the
expectation
of
who
wished
not
well
unto
our
that
upon
the
setting
of
that
bright
queen
of
most
happy
some
thick
and
palpable
clouds
of
darkness
would
so
have
overshadowed
this
that
men
should
have
been
in
doubt
which
way
they
were
to
and
that
it
should
hardly
be
who
was
to
direct
the
unsettled
the
appearance
of
your
as
of
the
in
his
instantly
dispelled
those
supposed
and
surmised
and
gave
unto
all
that
were
well
affected
exceeding
cause
of
especially
when
we
beheld
the
government
established
in
your
highness
and
your
hopeful
by
an
undoubted
and
this
also
accompanied
with
peace
and
tranquility
at
home
and
but
among
all
our
there
was
no
one
that
more
filled
our
than
the
blessed
continuance
of
the
preaching
of
sacred
word
among
which
is
that
inestimable
which
excelleth
all
the
riches
of
because
the
fruit
thereof
extendeth
not
only
to
the
time
spent
in
this
transitory
but
directeth
and
disposeth
men
unto
that
eternal
happiness
which
is
above
in
then
not
to
suffer
this
to
fall
to
the
but
rather
to
take
it
and
to
continue
it
in
that
wherein
the
famous
predecessor
of
your
highness
did
leave
to
go
forward
with
the
confidence
and
resolution
of
a
man
in
maintaining
the
truth
of
and
propagating
it
far
and
is
that
which
hath
so
bound
and
firmly
knit
the
hearts
of
all
your
loyal
and
religious
people
unto
that
your
very
name
is
precious
among
their
eye
doth
behold
you
with
and
they
bless
you
in
their
as
that
sanctified
under

the
immediate
author
of
their
true
and
this
their
contentment
doth
not
diminish
or
but
every
day
increaseth
and
taketh
when
they
that
the
zeal
of
your
majesty
toward
the
house
of
god
doth
not
slack
or
go
but
is
more
and
more
manifesting
itself
abroad
in
the
farthest
parts
of
by
writing
in
defence
of
the
hath
given
such
a
blow
unto
that
man
of
as
will
not
be
and
every
day
at
by
religious
and
learned
by
frequenting
the
house
of
by
hearing
the
word
by
cherishing
the
teachers
by
caring
for
the
as
a
most
tender
and
loving
nursing
there
are
infinite
arguments
of
this
right
christian
and
religious
affection
in
your
but
none
is
more
forcible
to
declare
it
to
others
than
the
vehement
and
perpetuated
desire
of
accomplishing
and
publishing
of
this
which
now
with
all
humility
we
present
unto
your
for
when
your
highness
had
once
out
of
deep
judgment
apprehended
how
convenient
it
that
out
of
the
original
sacred
together
with
comparing
of
the
both
in
our
and
other
foreign
of
many
worthy
men
who
went
before
there
should
be
one
more
exact
translation
of
the
holy
scriptures
into
the
your
majesty
did
never
desist
to
urge
and
to
excite
those
to
whom
it
was
that
the
work
might
be
and
that
the
business
might
be
expedited
in
so
decent
a
as
a
matter
of
such
importance
might
justly
and
now
at
by
the
mercy
of
and
the
continuance
of
our
it
being
brought
unto
such
a
as
that
we
have
great
hopes
that
the
church
of
shall
reap
good
fruit
we
hold
it
our
duty
to
offer
it
to
your
not
only
as
to
our
king
and
but
as
to
the
principal
mover
and
author
of
the
humbly
craving
of
your
most
sacred
that
since
things
of
this
quality
have
ever
been
subject
to
the
censures
of
illmeaning
and
discontented
it
may
receive
approbation
and
patronage
from
so
learned
and
judicious
a
prince
as
your
highness
whose
allowance
and
acceptance
of
our
labours
shall
more
honour
and
encourage
than
all
the
calumniations
and
hard
interpretations
of
other
men
shall
dismay
so
that
on
the
one
we
shall
be
traduced
by
popish
persons
at
home
or
who
therefore
will
malign
because
we
are
poor
instruments
to
make
holy
truth
to
be
yet
more
and
more
known
unto
the
whom
they
desire
still
to
keep
in
ignorance
and
or
on
the
other
we
shall
be
maligned
by
selfconceited
who
run
their
own
and
give
liking
unto
but
what
is
framed
by
and
hammered
on
their
we
may
rest
supported
within
by
the
truth
and
innocency
of
a
good
having
walked
the
ways
of
simplicity
and
as
before
the
and
sustained
without
by
the
powerful
protection
of
your
grace
and
which
will
ever
give
countenance
to
honest
and
christian
endeavors
against
bitter
censures

the

bless
your

nations
of
the
earth
shall
be
blessed
in
for
i
know
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
household
after
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
to
do
justice
and
that
the
lord
may
bring
upon
abraham
that
which
he
hath
spoken
of
and
the
lord
because
the
cry
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
is
and
because
their
sin
is
very
i
will
go
down
and
see
whether
they
have
done
altogether
according
to
the
cry
of
which
is
come
unto
and
if
i
will
and
the
men
turned
their
faces
from
and
went
toward
but
abraham
stood
yet
before
the
and
abraham
drew
and
wilt
thou
also
destroy
the
righteous
with
the
peradventure
there
be
fifty
righteous
within
the
wilt
thou
also
destroy
and
not
spare
the
place
for
the
fifty
righteous
that
that
be
far
from
thee
to
do
after
this
to
slay
the
righteous
with
the
and
that
the
righteous
should
be
as
the
that
be
far
from
shall
not
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
do
and
the
lord
if
i
find
in
sodom
fifty
righteous
within
the
then
i
will
spare
all
the
place
for
their
and
abraham
answered
and
behold
i
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
which
dust
and
peradventure
there
shall
lack
five
of
the
fifty
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
city
for
and
he
if
i
find
there
forty
and
i
will
not
destroy
and
he
spake
unto
him
yet
and
peradventure
there
shall
be
forty
found
and
he
i
will
not
do
for
and
he
said
oh
let
not
the
lord
be
and
i
will
peradventure
there
shall
thirty
be
found
and
he
i
will
not
do
if
i
find
thirty
and
he
behold
i
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
peradventure
there
shall
be
twenty
found
and
he
i
will
not
destroy
for
and
he
oh
let
not
the
lord
be
and
i
will
speak
yet
but
this
peradventure
ten
shall
be
found
and
he
i
will
not
destroy
for
and
the
lord
went
his
as
soon
as
he
had
left
communing
with
and
abraham
returned
unto
his
chapter
and
there
came
two
angels
to
sodom
at
and
lot
sat
in
the
gate
of
and
lot
seeing
rose
up
to
meet
and
he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
toward
the
and
he
behold
my
turn
i
pray
into
your
and
tarry
all
and
wash
your
and
ye
shall
rise
up
and
go
on
your
and
they
but
we
will
abide
in
the
street
all
and
he
pressed
upon
them
and
they
turned
in
unto
and
entered
into
his
and
he
made
them
a
and
did
bake
unleavened
and
they
did
but
before
they
lay
the
men
of
the
the
men
of
compassed
the
house
both
old
and
all
the
people
from
every
and
they
called
unto
and
said
unto
where
the
men
which
came
in
to
thee
this
bring
them
out
unto
that
we
may
know
and
lot
went
out
at
the
door
unto
and
shut
the
door
after
and
i
pray
do
not
so
behold
i
have
two
daughters
which
have
not
known
let
i
pray
bring
them
out
unto
and
do
ye
to
them
as
good
in
your
only
unto
these
men
do
for
therefore
came
they
under
the
shadow
of
my
and
they
stand
and
they
said
this
one
came
in
to
and
he
will
needs
be
a
now
will
we
deal
worse
with
than
with
and
they
pressed
sore
upon
the
and
came
near
to
break
the
but
the
men
put
forth
their
and
pulled
lot
into
the
house
to
and
shut
to
the
and
they
smote
the
men
that
at
the
door
of
the
house
with
both
small
and
so
that
they
wearied
themselves
to
find
the

the
men
said
unto

son
in
and
thy
and
thy
and
whatsoever
thou
hast
in
the
bring

the
lord
hath
sent

unto
his
sons
in
which
married
his
and
get
you
out
of
this
for
the
lord
will

this
but
he
seemed
as
one
that
mocked
unto
his
sons
in
and
when
the
morning
then
the
angels
hastened
take
thy
and
thy
two
which
are
lest
thou
be
consumed
in
the
iniquity
of
the
and
while
he
the
men
laid
hold
upon
his
and
upon
the
hand
of
his
and
upon
the
hand
of
his
two
the
lord
being
merciful
unto
and
they
brought
him
and
set
him
without
the
and
it
came
to
when
they
had
brought
them
forth
that
he
escape
for
thy
look
not
behind
neither
stay
thou
in
all
the
escape
to
the
lest
thou
be
and
lot
said
unto
not
my
behold
thy
servant
hath
found
grace
in
thy
and
thou
hast
magnified
thy
which
thou
hast
shewed
unto
me
in
saving
my
and
i
cannot
escape
to
the
lest

and
i
behold
this
city
near
to

and
it
a
little
let
me
escape

and
my
soul

he
said
unto

concerning
this
thing
that

will
not
overthrow
this
for
the
which
thou
hast
haste
escape
for
i
cannot
do
any
thing
till
thou
be
come
therefore
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
the
sun
was
risen
upon
the
earth
when
lot
entered
into
then
the
lord
rained
upon
sodom
and
upon
gomorrah
brimstone
and
fire
from
the
lord
out
of
and
he
overthrew
those
and
all
the
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
and
that
which
grew
upon
the
but
his
wife
looked
back
from
behind
and
she
became
a
pillar
of
and
abraham
gat
up
early
in
the
morning
to
the
place
where
he
stood
before
the
and
he
looked
toward
sodom
and
and
toward
all
the
land
of
the
and
the
smoke
of
the
country
went
up
as
the
smoke
of
a
and
it
came
to
when
god
destroyed
the
cities
of
the
that
god
remembered
and
sent
lot
out
of
the
midst
of
the
when
he
overthrew
the
cities
in
the
which
lot
and
lot
went
up
out
of
and
dwelt
in
the
and
his
two
daughters
with
for
he
feared
to
dwell
in
and
he
dwelt
in
a
he
and
his
two
and
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
our
father
and
not
a
man
in
the
earth
to
come
in
unto
us
after
the
manner
of
all
the
let
us
make
our
father
drink
and
we
will
lie
with
that
we
may
preserve
seed
of
our
and
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
and
the
firstborn
went
and
lay
with
her
and
he
perceived
not
when
she
lay
nor
when
she
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
i
lay
yesternight
with
my
let
us
make
him
drink
wine
this
night
and
go
thou
lie
with
that
we
may
preserve
seed
of
our
and
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night
and
the
younger
and
lay
with
and
he
perceived
not
when
she
lay
nor
when
she
thus
were
both
the
daughters
of
lot
with
child
by
their
and
the
firstborn
bare
a
and
called
his
name
the
same
the
father
of
the
moabites
unto
this
and
the
she
also
bare
a
and
called
his
name
the
same
the
father
of
the
children
of
ammon
unto
this
chapter
and
abraham
journeyed
from
thence
toward
the
south
and
dwelled
between
kadesh
and
and
sojourned
in
and
abraham
said
of
sarah
his
she
my
and
abimelech
king
of
gerar
and
took
but
god
came
to
abimelech
in
a
dream
by
and
said
to
thou
a
dead
for
the
woman
which
thou
hast
for
she
a
but
abimelech
had
not
come
near
and
he
wilt
thou
slay
also
a
righteous
said
he
not
unto
she
my
and
even
she
herself
he
my
in
the
integrity
of
my
heart
and
innocency
of
my
hands
have
i
done
and
god
said
unto
him
in
a
i
know
that
thou
didst
this
in
the
integrity
of
thy
for
i
also
withheld
thee
from
sinning
against
therefore
suffered
i
thee
not
to
touch
now
therefore
restore
the
man
for
he
a
and
he
shall
pray
for
and
thou
shalt
and
if
thou
restore
know
thou
that
thou
shalt
surely
and
all
that
therefore
abimelech
rose
early
in
the
and
called
all
his
and
told
all
these
things
in
their
and
the
men
were
sore
then
abimelech
called
and
said
unto
what
hast
thou
done
unto
and
what
have
i
offended
that
thou
hast
brought
on
me
and
on
my
kingdom
a
great
thou
hast
done
deeds
unto
me
that
ought
not
to
be
and
abimelech
said
unto
what
sawest
that
thou
hast
done
this
and
abraham
because
i
surely
the
fear
of
god
not
in
this
and
they
will
slay
me
for
my
and
yet
indeed
my
she
the
daughter
of
my
but
not
the
daughter
of
my
and
she
became
my
and
it
came
to
when
god
caused
me
to
wander
from
my
that
i
said
unto
this
thy
kindness
which
thou
shalt
shew
unto
at
every
place
whither
we
shall
say
of
he
my
and
abimelech
took
and
and
and
and
gave
unto
and
restored
him
sarah

and
abimelech
my
land
before

where
it
pleaseth
and
unto
sarah
he
i
have
given
thy
brother
a
thousand
of
he
to
thee
a
covering
of
the
unto
all
that
with

the
thing

and
because
of

abimelech
what
this
thou
hast
done
unto
one
of
the
people

lightly
have

thou
shouldest
have
brought
guiltiness
upon

abimelech
charged
all
he
that
toucheth
this
man
or
his
wife
shall
surely
be
put
to

isaac
sowed
in
that
and
received
in
the
same
year
an

the
lord
blessed

the
man
waxed

made
to
chapter
and
it
came
to

after
these
the
butler
of
the
king
of
egypt
and
baker
had
offended
their
lord
the
king
of
and
pharaoh
was
wroth
against
two
his
against
the
chief
of
the
and
against
the
chief
of

and
he
put
them
in

they
dreamed
a
dream
both
of
each

the
interpretation
of
his
the
butler
and
the
baker
of
the
king
of
which
bound
in
the
and
joseph
came
in
unto
them
in
the
and
looked
upon
they
and
he
asked
officers
that
with
him
in
the
ward
of
his
wherefore
look
ye
sadly
to
and
they
said
unto
we
have
dreamed
a
and
no
interpreter
of
and
joseph
said
unto
not
interpretations
to
tell
me
i
pray
and
the
chief
butler
told
his
dream
to
and
said
to
in
my
a
vine
before
and
in
the
vine
three
and
it
as
though
it
her
blossoms
shot
and
the
clusters
thereof
brought
forth
ripe
and
cup
in
my
and
i
took
the
and
pressed
them
into
and
i
gave
the
cup
into
and
joseph
said
unto
this
the
interpretation
of
the
three
branches
three
yet
within
three
days
shall
pharaoh
lift
up
thine
and
restore
thee
unto
thy
and
thou
shalt
deliver
cup
into
his
after
the
former
manner
when
thou
wast
his
but
think
on
me
when
it
shall
be
well
with
and
shew
i
pray
unto
and
make
mention
of
me
unto
and
bring
me
out
of
this
for
indeed
i
was
stolen
away
out
of
the
land
of
the
and
here
also
have
i
done
nothing
that
they
should
put
me
into
the
when
the
chief
baker
saw
that
the
interpretation
was
he
said
unto
i
also
in
my
three
white
baskets
on
my
and
in
the
uppermost
basket
of
all
manner
of
bakemeats
for
and
the
birds
did
eat
them
out
of
the
basket
upon
my
and
joseph
answered
and
this
the
interpretation
the
three
baskets
three
yet
within
three
days
shall
pharaoh
lift
up
thy
head
from
off
and
shall
hang
thee
on
a
and
the
birds
shall
eat
thy
flesh
from
off
and
it
came
to
pass
the
third
that
he
made
a
feast
unto
all
his
and
he
lifted
up
the
head
of
the
chief
butler
and
of
the
chief
baker
among
his
and
he
restored
the
chief
butler
unto
his
butlership
and
he
gave
the
cup
into

he
hanged
the
chief
as
joseph
had
interpreted
to
yet
did
not
the
chief
butler
remember
but
forgat
chapter
and
it
came
to

at
the
end
of
two

stood
by
the
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
well
favoured

and
they
fed
in
a
seven
other

the
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed
kine
did
eat
up
the
seven
well
favoured
and
fat
so
pharaoh
and
he
slept
and
dreamed
the
second
seven
ears
of
corn
came
up
upon
one
rank
and
seven
thin
ears
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
up
after
and
the
seven
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
rank
and
full
and
pharaoh
a
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
his
spirit
was
and
he
sent
and
called
for
all
the
magicians
of
and
all
the
wise
men
and
pharaoh
told
them
his
but
none
that
could
interpret
them
unto
then
spake
the
chief
butler
unto
i
do
remember
my
faults
this
pharaoh
was
wroth
with
his
and
put
me
in
ward
in
the
captain
of
the
me
and
the
chief
and
we
dreamed
a
dream
in
one
i
and
we
dreamed
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
and
there
with
us
a
young
an
servant
to
the
captain
of
the
and
we
told
and
he
interpreted
to
us
our
to
each
man
according
to
his
dream
he
did
and
it
came
to
as
he
interpreted
to
so
it
me
he
restored
unto
mine
and
him
he
then
pharaoh
sent
and
called
and
they
brought
him
hastily
out
of
the
and
he
shaved
and
changed
his
and
came
in
unto
and
pharaoh
said
unto
i
have
dreamed
a
and
none
that
can
interpret
and
i
have
heard
say
of
thou
canst
understand
a
dream
to
interpret
and
joseph
answered
not
in
god
shall
give
pharaoh
an
answer
of
and
pharaoh
said
unto
in
my
i
stood
upon
the
bank
of
the
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
fatfleshed
and
well
and
they
fed
in
a
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
poor
and
very
ill
favoured
and
such
as
i
never
saw
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
for
and
the
lean
and
the
ill
favoured
kine
did
eat
up
the
first
seven
fat
and
when
they
had
eaten
them
it
could
not
be
known
that
they
had
eaten
but
they
still
ill
as
at
the
so
i
and
i
saw
in
my
seven
ears
came
up
in
one
full
and
seven
blasted
with
the
east
sprung
up
after
and
the
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
good
and
i
told
unto
the
but
none
that
could
declare
to
and
joseph
said
unto
the
dream
of
pharaoh
god
hath
shewed
pharaoh
what
he
about
to
the
seven
good
kine
seven
and
the
seven
good
ears
seven
the
dream
and
the
seven
thin
and
ill
favoured
kine
that
came
up
after
them
seven
and
the
seven
empty
ears
blasted
with
the
east
wind
shall
be
seven
years
of
this
the
thing
which
i
have
spoken
unto
what
god
about
to
do
he
sheweth
unto
there
come
seven
years
of
great
plenty
throughout
all
the
land
of
and
there
shall
arise
after
them
seven
years
of
and
all
the
plenty
shall
be
forgotten
in
the
land
of
and
the
famine
shall
consume
the
and
the
plenty
shall
not
be
known
in
the
land
by
reason
of
that
famine
for
it
very
and
for
that
the
dream
was
doubled
unto
pharaoh
because
the
thing
established
by
and
god
will
shortly
bring
it
to
now
therefore
let
pharaoh
look
out
a
man
discreet
and
and
set
him
over
the
land
of
let
pharaoh
do
and
let
him
appoint
officers
over
the
and
take
up
the
fifth
part
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
seven
plenteous
and
let
them
gather
all
the
food
of
those
good
years
that
and
lay
up
corn
under
the
hand
of
and
let
them
keep
food
in
the
and
that
food
shall
be
for
store
to
the
land
against
the
seven
years
of
which
shall
be
in
the
land
of
that
the
land
perish
not
through
the
and
the
thing
was
good
in
the
eyes
of
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
his
and
pharaoh
said
unto
his
can
we
find
a
as
this
a
man
in
whom
the
spirit
of
god
and
pharaoh
said
unto
forasmuch

so
discreet

wise
as
thou

shalt
be
over
my
and
according
unto
thy
word
shall
all
my
people
be
only
in
the
throne

be
greater
than
and
pharaoh
said
unto
i
have
set
thee
over
all
the
land
of
and
pharaoh
took
off
his
ring
from
his

put
it
upon

arrayed
him
in
vestures
of
fine

and
they
built
for

treasure
pithom
and
but
the
more
they
afflicted
the
more
they
multiplied

and
they
were
grieved
because
of
the
children
of
and
the
egyptians
made
the
children
of
israel
to
serve
with
and
they
made
their
lives
bitter

hard
in

of
service
in

all
their
wherein
they
made

when

a
then
ye

a
then
she
shall

the
midwives
feared
and
did
not
as
the
king
of
egypt
commanded
but
saved
the
men
children
and
the
king
of
egypt
called
for
the
and
said
unto
why
have
ye
done
this
and
have
saved
the
men
children
and
the
midwives
said
unto
because
the
hebrew
women
not
as
the
egyptian
for
they
and
are
delivered
ere
the
midwives
come
in
unto
therefore
god
dealt
well
with
the
and
the
people
and
waxed
very
and
it
came
to
because
the
midwives
feared
that
he
made
them
and
pharaoh
charged
all
his
every
son
that
is
born
ye
shall
cast
into
the
and
every
daughter
ye
shall
save
chapter
and
there
went
a
man
of
the
house
of
and
took
a
daughter
of
and
the
woman
and
bare
a
and
when
she
saw
him
that
he
goodly
she
hid
him
three
and
when
she
could
not
longer
hide
she
took
for
him
an
ark
of
and
daubed
it
with
slime
and
with
and
put
the
child
and
she
laid
in
the
flags
by
the
and
his
sister
stood
afar
to
wit
what
would
be
done
to
and
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
came
down
to
wash
at
the
and
her
maidens
walked
along
by
the
and
when
she
saw
the
ark
among
the
she
sent
her
maid
to
fetch
and
when
she
had
opened
she
saw
the
the
babe
and
she
had
compassion
on
and
this
of
the
then
said
his
sister
to
shall
i
go
and
call
to
thee
a
nurse
of
the
hebrew
that
she
may
nurse
the
child
for
and
daughter
said
to
and
the
maid
went
and
called
the
and
daughter
said
unto
take
this
child
and
nurse
it
for
and
i
will
give
thy
and
the
woman
took
the
and
nursed
and
the
child
and
she
brought
him
unto
and
he
became
her
and
she
called
his
name
and
she
because
i
drew
him
out
of
the
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
when
moses
was
that
he
went
out
unto
his
and
looked
on
their
and
he
spied
an
egyptian
smiting
an
one
of
his
and
he
looked
this
way
and
that
and
when
he
saw
that
no
he
slew
the
and
hid
him
in
the
and
when
he
went
out
the
second
two
men
of
the
hebrews
strove
and
he
said
to
him
that
did
the
wherefore
smitest
thou
thy
and
he
who
made
thee
a
prince
and
a
judge
over
intendest
thou
to
kill
as
thou
killedst
the
and
moses
and
surely
this
thing
is
now
when
pharaoh
heard
this
he
sought
to
slay
but
moses
fled
from
the
face
of
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
and
he
sat
down
by
a
now
the
priest
of
midian
had
seven
and
they
came
and
drew
and
filled
the
troughs
to
water
their
and
the
shepherds
came
and
drove
them
but
moses
stood
up
and
helped
and
watered
their
and
when
they
came
to
reuel
their
he
how
it
ye
are
come
so
soon
to
and
they
an
egyptian
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
and
also
drew
enough
for
and
watered
the
and
he
said
unto
his
and
where
why
it
ye
have
left
the
call
that
he
may
eat
and
moses
was
content
to
dwell
with
the
and
he
gave
moses
zipporah
his
and
she
bare
a
and
he
called
his
name
for
he
i
have
been
a
stranger
in
a
strange
and
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
that
the
king
of
egypt
and
the
children
of
israel
sighed
by
reason
of
the
and
they
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
god
by
reason
of
the
and
god
heard
their
and
god
remembered
his
covenant
with
with
and
with
and
god
looked
upon
the
children
of
and
god
had
respect
unto
chapter
now
moses
kept
the
flock
of
jethro
his
father
in
the
priest
of
and
he
led
the
flock
to
the
backside
of
the
and
came
to
the
mountain
of
to
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
in
a
flame
of
fire
out
of
the
midst
of
a
and
he
the
bush
burned
with
and
the
bush
not
and
moses
i
will
now
turn
and
see
this
great
why
the
bush
is
not
and
when
the
lord
saw
that
he
turned
aside
to
god

unto
him
out
of
the
midst
of
the
and
and

upon

have
surely
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people

reason
of
their

so
they
went
and
searched
the
land
from
the
wilderness
of
zin
unto
as
men
come
to
and
they
ascended
by
the
and
came
unto
where
and
the
children
of
hebron
was
built
seven
years
before
zoan
in
and
they
came
unto
the
brook
of
and
cut
down
from
thence
a
branch
with
one
cluster
of
and
they
bare
it
between
two
upon
a
and
of
the
and
of
the
the
place
was
called
the
brook
because
of
the
cluster
of
grapes
which
the
children
of
israel
cut
down
from
and
they
returned
from
searching
of
the
land
after
forty
and
they
went
and
came
to
and
to
and
to
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
unto
the
wilderness
of
to
and
brought
back
word
unto
and
unto
all
the
and
shewed
them
the
fruit
of
the
and
they
told
and
we
came
unto
the
land
whither
thou
sentest
and
surely
it
floweth
with
milk
and
and
this
the
fruit
of
nevertheless
the
people
strong
that
dwell
in
the
and
the
cities
very
and
moreover
we
saw
the
children
of
anak
the
amalekites
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
dwell
in
the

the
canaanites
dwell
by
the

by
the
coast
of
and
caleb
stilled
the
people
before
and
let
us
go
up
at
and
possess
for
we
are
well
able
to
overcome
but
the
men
that
went
up
with
him
we
be
not
able
to
go
up
against
the
for
they
stronger
than
and
they
brought
up
an
evil
report
of
the
land
which
they
had
searched
unto
the
children
of
the
through
which
we
have
gone
to
search
a
land
that
eateth
up
the
inhabitants
and
all
the
people
that
we
saw
in
it
men
of
a
great
and
there
we
saw
the
the
sons
of
of
the
and
we
were
in
our
own
sight
as
and
so
we
were
in
their
chapter
and
all
the
congregation
lifted
up
their
and
and
the
people
wept
that
and
all
the
children
of
israel
murmured
against
moses
and
against
and
the
whole
congregation
said
unto
would
god
that
we
had
died
in
the
land
of
or
would
god
we
had
died
in
this
and
wherefore
hath
the
lord
brought
us
unto
this
to
fall
by
the
that
our
wives
and
our
children
should
be
a
were
it
not
better
for
us
to
return
into
and
they
said
one
to
let
us
make
a
and
let
us
return
into
then
moses
and
aaron
fell
on
their
faces
before
all
the
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
and
joshua
the
son
of
and
caleb
the
son
of
of
them
that
searched
the
rent
their
and
they
spake
unto
all
the
company
of
the
children
of
the
which
we
passed
through
to
search
an
exceeding
good
if
the
lord
delight
in
then
he
will
bring
us
into
this
and
give
it
a
land
which
floweth
with
milk
and
only
rebel
not
ye
against
the
neither
fear
ye
the
people
of
the
for
they
bread
for
their
defence
is
departed
from
and
the
lord
with
fear
them
but
all
the
congregation
bade
stone
them
with
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
all
the
children
of
and
the
lord
said
unto
how
long
will
this
people
provoke
and
how
long
will
it
be
ere
they
believe
for
all
the
signs
which
i
have
shewed
among
i
will
smite
them
with
the
and
disinherit
and
will
make
of
thee
a
greater
nation
and
mightier
than
and
moses
said
unto
the
then
the
egyptians
shall
hear
thou
broughtest
up
this
people
in
thy
might
from
among
and
they
will
tell
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
they
have
heard
that
thou
lord
among
this
that
thou
lord
art
seen
face
to
and
thy
cloud
standeth
over
and
thou
goest
before
by
day
time
in
a
pillar
of
a
and
in
a
pillar
of
fire
by
now
thou
shalt
kill
this
people
as
one
then
the
nations
which
have
heard
the
fame
of
thee
will
because
the
lord
was
not
able
to
bring
this
people
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
therefore
he
hath
slain
them
in
the
and
i
beseech
let
the
power
of
my
lord
be
according
as
thou
hast
the
lord
and
of
great
forgiving
iniquity
and
and
by
no
means
clearing
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
i
beseech
the
iniquity
of
this
people
according
unto
the
greatness
of
thy
and
as
thou
hast
forgiven
this
from
egypt
even
until
and
the
lord
i
have
pardoned
according
to
thy
but
truly
i
all
the
earth
shall
be
filled
with
the
glory
of
the
because
all
those
men
which
have
seen
my
and
my
which
i
did
in
egypt
and
in
the
and
have
tempted
me
now
these
ten
and
have
not
hearkened
to
my
surely
they
shall
not
see
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
neither
shall
any
of
them
that
provoked
me
see
but
my
servant
because
he
had
another
spirit
with
and
hath
followed
me
him
will
i
bring
into
the
land
whereinto

morrow
turn
and
get
you
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
how
long
i
bear
this
evil
which
murmur
against
i
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children

to
your
whole

years
old

not
come
into
the
which

sware
to
make

caleb
the
son
of

they
shall
know
the
land

these
sayings
unto
all

edom
came
out
against
him
with
much

with
a
strong
thus
edom
refused
to

passage
through

wherefore
israel
turned

journeyed
from

spake
unto

shall
not
enter

strip
aaron
of

put
them
upon
eleazar
his

they
went
up
into

stripped
aaron
of

died
there
in

vowed
a
vow
unto

if
thou
wilt
indeed
deliver
this
people
into

will
utterly
destroy

hearkened
to
the
voice
of

they
utterly
destroyed

the
soul
of

give
notwithstanding
ye
would
not
go
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
your
and
ye
murmured
in
your
and
because
the
lord
hated
he
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
to
destroy
whither
shall
we
go
our
brethren
have
discouraged
our
the
people
greater
and
taller
than
the
cities
great
and
walled
up
to
and
moreover
we
have
seen
the
sons
of
the
anakims
then
i
said
unto
dread
neither
be
afraid
of
the
lord
your
god
which
goeth
before
he
shall
fight
for
according
to
all
that
he
did
for
you
in
egypt
before
your
and
in
the
where
thou
hast
seen
how
that
the
lord
thy
god
bare
as
a
man
doth
bear
his
in
all
the
way
that
ye
until
ye
came
into
this
yet
in
this
thing
ye
did
not
believe
the
lord
your
who
went
in
the
way
before
to
search
you
out
a
place
to
pitch
your
tents
in
fire
by
to
shew
you
by
what
way
ye
should
and
in
a
cloud
by
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
your
and
was
and
surely
there
shall
not
one
of
these
men
of
this
evil
generation
see
that
good
which
i
sware
to
give
unto
your
save
caleb
the
son
of
he
shall
see
and
to
him
will
i
give
the
land
that
he
hath
trodden
and
to
his
because
he
hath
wholly
followed
the
also
the
lord
was
angry
with
me
for
your
thou
also
shalt
not
go
in
joshua
the
son
of
which
standeth
before
he
shall
go
in
encourage
for
he
shall
cause
israel
to
inherit
moreover
your
little
which
ye
said
should
be
a
and
your
which
in
that
day
had
no
knowledge
between
good
and
they
shall
go
in
and
unto
them
will
i
give
and
they
shall
possess
but
turn
and
take
your
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
then
ye
answered
and
said
unto
we
have
sinned
against
the
we
will
go
up
and
according
to
all
that
the
lord
our
god
commanded
and
when
ye
had
girded
on
every
man
his
weapons
of
ye
were
ready
to
go
up
into
the
and
the
lord
said
unto
say
unto
go
not
neither
for
i
not
among
lest
ye
be
smitten
before
your
so
i
spake
unto
and
ye
would
not
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
and
went
presumptuously
up
into
the
and
the
which
dwelt
in
that
came
out
against
and
chased
as
bees
and
destroyed
you
in
unto
and
ye
returned
and
wept
before
the
but
the
lord
would
not
hearken
to
your
nor
give
ear
unto
so
ye
abode
in
kadesh
many
according
unto
the
days
that
ye
abode
chapter
then
we
and
took
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
as
the
lord
spake
unto
and
we
compassed
mount
seir
many
and
the
lord
spake
unto
ye

compassed
this
mountain

you
and
command
thou
the
ye
to
pass
through
the
coast
of
your
brethren
the
children
of
which
dwell
in
and
they
shall
be
afraid
of
take
ye
good
heed
unto
yourselves
meddle
not
with
for
i
will
not
give
you
of
their
not
so
much
as
a
foot
because
i
have
given
mount
seir
unto
esau
a
ye
shall
buy
meat
of
them
for
that
ye
may
and
ye
shall
also
buy
water
of
them
for
that
ye
may
for
the
lord
thy
god
hath
blessed
thee
in
all
the
works
of
thy
he
knoweth
thy
walking
through
this
great
these
forty
years
the
lord
thy
god
with
thou
hast
lacked
and
when
we
passed
by
from
our
brethren
the
children
of
which
dwelt
in
through
the
way
of
the
plain
from
and
from
we
turned
and
passed
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
and
the
lord
said
unto
distress
not
the
neither
contend
with
them
in
for
i
will
not

because
i

which
also
were
accounted
as
the
but
the
moabites
call
them
the
horims
also
dwelt
in
seir
but
the
children
of
esau
succeeded
when
they
had
destroyed
them
from
before
and
dwelt
in
their
as
israel
did
unto
the
land
of
his
which
the
lord
gave
unto
now

and
get
you
over

we
went
over
the
brook
and
the
space
in
which
we
came
from
until
we
were

over
the
brook
thirty
and
eight
until
all
the
generation
of
the
men
of
war
were
wasted
out
from
among
the
as
the
lord
sware
unto
for
indeed
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
to
destroy
them
from
among
the
until
they
were
so
it
came
to
when
all
the
men
of
war
were
consumed
and
dead
from
among
the
that
the
lord
spake
unto
thou
art
to
pass
over
through
the
coast
of
this
and
thou
comest
nigh
over
against
the
children
of

destroyed
them
before

they
succeeded
and
dwelt
in
their
as
he
did
to
the
children
of
which
dwelt
in
when
he
destroyed
the
horims
from
before

at
that
o

thou
hast
begun
to
shew
thy
servant
thy
and
thy
mighty
for
what
god
in

thy
and
according

thy
i
pray
let

the
good
land
that
beyond
that
goodly
and
but
the
lord
was
wroth
with
me
for
your
and
would
not
hear
and
the
lord
said
unto
let
it
suffice
speak
no
more
unto
me
of
this
get
thee
up
into
the
top
of

lift
up
thine
eyes

and
and
behold
with
thine

and
strengthen

he
shall
go
over
before
this
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
inherit
the
land
which
thou
shalt
so
we
abode
in
the
valley
over
against
chapter
now
therefore
o
unto
the
statutes
and
unto
the
which
i
teach
for
to
do
that
ye
may
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
giveth
ye
shall
not
add
unto
the
word
which
i
command
neither
shall
ye
diminish
from
that
ye
may
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
your
eyes
have
seen
what
the
lord
did
because
of
for
all
the
men
that
followed
the
lord
thy
god
hath
destroyed
them
from
among
but
ye
that
did
cleave
unto
the
lord
your
god
alive
every
one
of
you
this
i
have
taught
you
statutes
and
even
as
the
lord
my
god
commanded
that
ye
should
do
so
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
keep
therefore
and
do
for
this
your
wisdom
and
your
understanding
in
the
sight
of
the
which
shall
hear
all
these
and
surely
this
great
nation
a
wise
and
understanding
for
what
nation
there
who
god
nigh
unto
as
the
lord
our
god
in
all
we
call
upon
him
and
what
nation
there
that
hath
statutes
and
judgments
righteous
as
all
this
which
i
set
before
you
this
only
take
heed
to
and
keep
thy
soul
lest
thou
forget
the
things
which
thine
eyes
have
and
lest
they
depart
from
thy
heart
all
the
days
of
thy
but
teach
them
thy
and
thy
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
when
the
lord
said
unto
gather
me
the
people
and
i
will
make
them
hear
my
that
they
may
learn
to
fear
me
all
the
days
that
they
shall
live
upon
the
and
they
may
teach
their
and
ye
came
near
and
stood
under
the
and
the
mountain
burned
with
fire
unto
the
midst
of
with
and
thick
and
the
lord
spake
unto
you
out
of
the
midst
of
the
ye
heard
the
voice
of
the
but
saw
no
only
a
and
he
declared
unto
you
his
which
he
commanded
you
to
ten
and
he
wrote
them
upon
two
tables
of
and
the
lord
commanded
me
at
that
time
to
teach
you
statutes
and
that
ye
might
do
them
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
to
possess
take
ye
therefore
good
heed
unto
for
ye
saw
no
manner
of
similitude
on
the
day
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
horeb
out
of
the
midst
of
the
lest
ye
corrupt
and
make
you
a
graven
the
similitude
of
any
the
likeness
of
male
or
the
likeness
of
any
beast
that
on
the
the
likeness
of
any
winged
fowl
that
flieth
in
the
the
likeness
of
any
thing
that
creepeth
on
the
the
likeness
of
any
fish
that
in
the
waters
beneath
the
and
lest
thou
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
and
when
thou
seest
the
and
the
and
the
all
the
host
of
shouldest
be
driven
to
worship
and
serve
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
divided
unto
all
nations
under
the
whole
but
the
lord
hath
taken
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
iron
out
of
to
be
unto
him
a
people
of
as
this
furthermore
the
lord
was
angry
with
me
for
your
and
sware
that
i
should
not
go
over
and
that
i
should
not
go
in
unto
that
good
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
an
but
i
must
die
in
this
i
must
not
go
over
but
ye
shall
go
and
possess
that
good
take
heed
unto
lest
ye
forget
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
which
he
made
with
and
make
you
a
graven
the
likeness
of
any
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
forbidden
for
the
lord
thy
god
a
consuming
a
jealous
when
thou
shalt
beget
and
and
ye
shall
have
remained
long
in
the
and
shall
corrupt
and
make
a
graven
the
likeness
of
any
and
shall
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
to
provoke
him
to
i
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
against
you
this
that
ye
shall
soon
utterly
perish
from
off
the
land
whereunto
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
ye
shall
not
prolong
days
upon
but
shall
utterly
be
and
the
lord
shall
scatter
you
among
the
and
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number
among
the
whither
the
lord
shall
lead
and
there
ye
shall

do
thee
good
at
thy
latter

thou
say
in
thine
my
power
and
the

hath
gotten
me
this

thou
shalt
remember
the

thy
for
he
that
giveth
thee
power
to
get
that
he
may
establish
his
covenant
which
he
sware
unto
thy
as
this
and
it
shall
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
thy
and
walk
after
other
and
serve
and
worship
i
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
as
the
nations
which
the
lord
destroyeth
before
your
so
shall
ye
because
ye
would
not
be
obedient
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
chapter
o
thou
to
pass
over
jordan
this
to
go
in
to
possess
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
cities
great
and
fenced
up
to
a
people
great
and
the
children
of
the
whom
thou
and
thou
hast
heard
who
can
stand
before
the
children
of
understand
therefore
this
that
the
lord
thy
god
he
which
goeth
over
before
a
consuming
fire
he
shall
destroy
and
he
shall
bring
them
down
before
thy
so
shalt
thou
drive
them
and
destroy
them
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
speak
not
thou
in
thine
after
that
the
lord
thy
god
hath
cast
them
out
from
before
for
my
righteousness
the
lord
hath
brought
me
in
to
possess
this
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
lord
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
not
for
thy
or
for
the
uprightness
of
thine
dost
thou
go
to
possess
their
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
and
that
he
may
perform
the
word
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
and
understand
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
not
this
good
land
to
possess
it
for
thy
for
thou
a
stiffnecked
forget
how
thou
provokedst
the

thy

wrath
in

ye
have
been

up
into
the

and
the

delivered
unto
me

me
the
two

thereof
into
the

when
the
lord
sent
you

because
they
obeyed
not

sware
that

because
she
hid
the

shouted
with
a
great
that
the
wall
fell
down
so
that
the
people
went
up
into
the
every

straight
before

they
took

and
they
utterly
destroyed
all
that
in
the
both
man
and
young
and
and
and
and
with
the
edge
of
the
but
joshua
had
said
unto
the
two
men
that
had
spied
out
the
go
into
the
and
bring
out
thence
the
and
all
that
she
as
ye
sware
unto
and
the
young
men
that
were
spies
went
and
brought
out
and
her
and
her
and
her
and
all
that
she
and
they
brought
out
all
her
and
left
them
without
the
camp
of
and
they
burnt
the
city
with
and
all
that
only
the
and
the
and
the
vessels
of
brass
and
of
they
put
into
the
treasury
of
the
house
of
the
and
joshua
saved
rahab
the
harlot
and
her
and
all
that
she
and
she
dwelleth
in
israel
unto
this
because
she
hid
the
which
joshua
sent
to
spy
out
and
joshua
adjured
at
that
cursed
the
man
before
the
that
riseth
up
and
buildeth
this
city
he
shall
lay
the
foundation
thereof
in
his
and
in
his
youngest
shall
he
set
up
the
gates
of
so
the
lord
was
with
and
his
fame
was
throughout
all
the
chapter
but
the
children
of
israel
committed
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
for
the
son
of
the
son
of
the
son
of
of
the
tribe
of
took
of
the
accursed
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
the
children
of
and
joshua
sent
men
from
jericho
to
which
beside
on
the
east
side
of
and
spake
unto
go
up
and
view
the
and
the
men
went
up
and
viewed
and
they
returned
to
and
said
unto
let
not
all
the
people
go
but
let
about
two
or
three
thousand
men
go
up
and
smite
make
not
all
the
people
to
labour
for
they
so
there
went
up
thither
of
the
people
about
three
thousand
and
they
fled
before
the
men
of
and
the
men
of
ai
smote
of
them
about
thirty
and
six
for
they
chased
them
before
the
gate
unto
and
smote
them
in
the
going
wherefore
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
became
as
and
joshua
rent
his
and
fell
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
until
the
he
and
the
elders
of
and
put
dust
upon
their
and
joshua
o
lord
wherefore
hast
thou
at
all
brought
this
people
over
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
to
destroy
would
to
god
we
had
been
and
dwelt
on
the
other
side
o
what
shall
i
when
israel
turneth
their
backs
before
their
for
the
canaanites
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
hear
and
shall
environ
us
and
cut
off
our
name
from
the
and
what
wilt
thou
do
unto
thy
great
and
the
lord
said
unto
get
thee
wherefore
liest
thou
thus
upon
thy
israel
hath
and
they
have
also
transgressed
my
covenant
which
i
commanded
for
they
have
even
taken
of
the
accursed
and
have
also
and
dissembled
and
they
have
put
even
among
their
own
therefore
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stand
before
their
turned
backs
before
their
because
they
were
neither
will
i
be
with
you
any
except
ye
destroy
the
accursed
from
among
sanctify
the
and
sanctify
yourselves
against
to
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
an
accursed
thing
in
the
midst
of
o
thou
canst
not
stand
before
thine
until
ye
take
away
the
accursed
thing
from
among
in
the
morning
therefore
ye
shall
be
brought
according
to
your
and
it
shall
the
tribe
which
the
lord
taketh
shall
come
according
to
the
families
and
the
family
which
the
lord
shall
take
shall
come
by
and
the
household
which
the
lord
shall
take
shall
come
man
by
and
it
shall
he
that
is
taken
with
the
accursed
thing
shall
be
burnt
with
he
and
all
that
he
because
he
hath
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
and
because
he
hath
wrought
folly
in
so
joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
and
brought
israel
by
their
and
the
tribe
of
judah
was
and
he
brought
the
family
of
and
he
took
the
family
of
the
and
he
brought
the
family
of
the
zarhites
man
by
and
zabdi
was
and
he
brought
his
household
man
by
and
the
son
of
the
son
of
the
son
of
of
the
tribe
of
was
and
joshua
said
unto
my
i
pray
glory
to
the
lord
god
of
and
make
confession
unto
and
tell
me
now
what
thou
hast
hide
not
from
and
achan
answered
and
indeed
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
god
of
and
thus
and
thus
have
i
when
i
saw
among
the
spoils
a
goodly
babylonish
and
two
hundred
shekels
of
and
a
wedge
of
gold
of
fifty
shekels
then
i
coveted
and
took
they
hid
in
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
my
and
the
silver
under
so
joshua
sent
and
they
ran
unto
the
hid
in
his
and
the
silver
under
and
they
took
them
out
of
the
midst
of
the
and
brought
them
unto
and
unto
all
the
children
of
and
laid
them
out
before
the

they
shall
be
in
your
and
their
gods
shall
be
a
snare
unto

it
came
to
when
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
these
words
unto
all
the
children
of
that
the
people
lifted
up
their
and
and
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
and
they
sacrificed
there
unto

and
when

unto
his
inheritance
to
possess

the
people
served
the
lord
all
the
days
of
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
outlived
who
had
seen
all
the
great
works
of
the
that
he
did
for
and
joshua
the
son
of
the
servant
of
the
an
hundred
and
ten
years
and
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
in
the
mount
of
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
and
also
all
that
generation
were
gathered
unto
their
and
there
arose
another
generation
after
which
knew
not
the
nor
yet
the
works
which
he
had
done
for
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
and
served
and
they
forsook
the
lord
god
of
their
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
and
followed
other
of
the
gods
of
the
people
that
round
about
and
bowed
themselves
unto
and
provoked
the
lord
to
and
they
forsook
the
and
served
baal
and
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
spoilers
that
spoiled
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
round
so
that
they
could
not
any
longer
stand
before
their
whithersoever
they
went
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
them
for
as
the
lord
had
and
as
the
lord
had
sworn
unto
and
they
were
greatly
nevertheless
the
lord
raised
up
which
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
spoiled
and
yet
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
but
they
went
a
whoring
after
other
and
bowed
themselves
unto
they
turned
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
their
fathers
walked
obeying
the
commandments
of
the
they
did
not
and
when
the
lord
raised
them
up
then
the
lord
was
with
the
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the
for
it
repented
the
lord
because
of
their
groanings
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
and
it
came
to
when
the
judge
was
they
and
corrupted
more
than
their
in
following
other
gods
to
serve
and
to
bow
down
unto
they
ceased
not
from
their
own
nor
from
their
stubborn
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
and
he
because
that
this
people
hath
transgressed
my
covenant
which
i
commanded
their
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
i
also
will
not
henceforth
drive
out
any
from
before
them
of
the
nations
which
joshua
left
when
he
that
through
them
i
may
prove
whether
they
will
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
walk
as
their
fathers
did
keep
or
therefore
the
lord
left
those
without
driving
them
out
neither
delivered
he
them
into
the
hand
of
chapter
now
these
the
nations
which
the
lord
to
prove
israel
by
as
many
as
had
not
known
all
the
wars
of
only
that
the
generations
of
the

they
were
to
prove

to
know
whether
they
would
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
which
he
commanded
their
fathers
by
the
hand
of

the
children
of

the
sight
of

the
therefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against

he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
king
of

the
children
of

served
eight
and
when
the

cried
unto

up
a
deliverer
to

the
spirit
of

the
lord
said
unto

not
then
gideon
built
an
altar
there
unto
the
and
called
it
unto
this
day
it
yet
in
ophrah
of
the
and
it
came
to

that
the

then
gideon
took
ten
men
of
his
and
did
as
the
lord
had
said
unto
and
it
because
he
feared
his
and
the
men
of
the
that
he
could
not
do
by
that
he
did
by
and
when
the

arose
early
in

the
altar
of

was
cast
and
the
grove
was
cut
down
that
by
and
the

and
when
they
enquired
and
they
gideon
the
son
of
joash
hath
done
this
then
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
bring
out
thy
that
he
may
because
he
hath
cast
down
the
altar
of
and
because
he
hath
cut
down
the
grove
that
by

they
came
up
to
meet

gideon
said
unto
if
thou
wilt
save

by
mine
as
thou
hast
i
will
put
a
fleece
of
wool
in
the
if

fleece
and
dry
upon
all
the
earth
then
shall
i
know
that
thou
wilt
save
israel
by
mine
as
thou
hast
and
it
was
for
he
rose
up
early
on
the
and
thrust
the
fleece
and
wringed
the
dew
out
of
the
a
bowl
full
of
and
gideon
said
unto
let
not
thine
anger
be
hot
against

i
will
speak
but
this
let
me
i
pray
but
this
once
with
the
let
it
now
be

only
upon
the
and
upon
all
the
ground
let
there
be
and
god
did
so
that
for
it
was
dry
upon
the
fleece
and
there
was
dew
on
all
the
chapter
then
who
and
all
the
people
that
with
rose
up
and
pitched
beside
the
well
of
so
that
the
host
of
the
midianites
were
on
the
north
side
of
by
the
hill
of

and
the
lord
said
unto
the
people
that

thee
too
many

me
to
give
the
midianites
into
their
lest

now
therefore

in
the
ears
of
the
whosoever

and
let
him
return
and
depart
early
from

and
there
returned
of
the
people
twenty

said
unto
the

he
brought
down
the
people
unto

said
unto
every

there
were

went
out

it
came
to

in
process
of
that
the

jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
did
not
ye
hate
and
expel
me
out
of
my
and
why
are
ye
come
unto
me
now
when
ye
are
in
and
the
elders
of
gilead
said
unto
therefore
we

that
thou
mayest
go
with
and
fight
against
the
children

jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
if

home
again
to
fight
against
the
children
of
and
the
lord
deliver
them
before

and
the
elders
of

said
unto
the
lord
be
witness
between
if
we
do
not
so
according
to
thy
then
jephthah
went
with
the
elders
of
and
the
people
made
him
head
and
captain
over
and
jephthah
uttered
all
his
words
before
the
lord
in
and
jephthah
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
that
thou
art
come
against
me
to
fight
in
my
and
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
answered
unto
the
messengers
of
because
israel
took
away
my
when
they
came
up
out
of
from
arnon
even
unto
and
unto
now
therefore
restore
those
again
and
jephthah
sent
messengers
again
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
and
said
unto
thus
saith
israel
took
not
away
the
land
of
nor
the
land
of
the
children
of
but
when
israel
came
up
from
and
walked
through
the
wilderness
unto
the
red
and
came
to
then
israel
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
let
i
pray
pass
through
thy
but
the
king
of
edom
would
not
hearken
and
in
like
manner
they
sent
unto
the
king
of
but
he
would
not
and
israel
abode
in
then
they
went
along
through
the
and
compassed
the
land
of
and
the
land
of
and
came
by
the
east
side
of
the
land
of
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
but
came
not
within
the
border
of
for
arnon
the
border
of
and
israel
sent
messengers
unto
sihon
king
of
the
the
king
of
and
israel
said
unto
let
us
we
pray
through
thy
land
into
my
but
sihon
trusted
not
israel
to
pass
through
his
but
sihon
gathered
all
his
people
and
pitched
in
and
fought
against
and
the
lord
god
of
israel
delivered
sihon
and
all
his
people
into
the
hand
of
and
they
smote
so
israel
possessed
all
the
land
of
the
the
inhabitants
of
that
and
they
possessed
all
the
coasts
of
the
from
arnon
even
unto
and
from
the
wilderness
even
unto
so
now
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
dispossessed
the
amorites
from
before
his
people
and
shouldest
thou
possess
wilt
not
thou
possess
that
which
chemosh
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
so
whomsoever
the
lord
our
god
shall
drive
out
from
before
them
will
we
and
now
thou
any
thing
better
than
balak
the
son
of
king
of
did
he
ever
strive
against
or
did
he
ever
fight
against
while
israel
dwelt
in
heshbon
and
her
and
in
aroer
and
her
and
in
all
the
cities
that
along
by
the
coasts
of
three
hundred
why
therefore
did
ye
not
recover
within
that
wherefore
i
have
not
sinned
against
but
thou
doest
me
wrong
to
war
against
the
lord
the
judge
be
judge
this
day
between
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
howbeit
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
jephthah
which
he
sent
then
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
and
he
passed
over
and
and
passed
over
mizpeh
of
and
from
mizpeh
of
gilead
he
passed
over
the
children
of
and
jephthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
and
if
thou
shalt
without
fail
deliver
the
children
of
ammon
into
mine
then
it
shall
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
of
the
doors
of
my
house
to
meet
when
i
return
in
peace
from
the
children
of
shall
surely
be
the
and
i
will
offer
it
up
for
a
burnt
so
jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
ammon
to
fight
against
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
his
and
he
smote
them
from
even
till
thou
come
to
twenty
and
unto
the
plain
of
the
with
a
very
great
thus
the
children
of
ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
of
and
jephthah
came
to
mizpeh
unto
his
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
and
she
only
beside
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
and
it
came
to
when
he
saw
that
he
rent
his
and
my
thou
hast
brought
me
very
and
thou
art
one
of
them
that
trouble
for
i
have
opened
my
mouth
unto
the
and
i
cannot
go
and
she
said
unto
my
thou
hast
opened
thy
mouth
unto
the
do
to
me
according
to
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
thy
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
of
thine
of
the
children
of
and
she
said
unto
her
let
this
thing
be
done
for
let
me
alone
two
that
i
may
go
up
and
down
upon
the
and
bewail
my
i
and
my
and
he
and
he
sent
her
away
two
and
she
went
with
her
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
the
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
that
she
returned
unto
her
who
did
with
her
to
his
vow
which
he
had
and
she
knew
no

it
was
a
custom
in
the
daughters
of
israel
went
yearly
to
lament
the
daughter
of
jephthah
the
gileadite
four
days
in
a
chapter
and
the
men
of
ephraim
gathered
themselves
and
went
and
said
unto

passedst
thou
over
to
fight
against
the
children
of
and
didst
not
call
us
to
go
with
we
will
burn
thine
house
upon
thee
with
and
jephthah
said
unto
i
and
my
people
were
at
great
strife
with
the
children
of
and
when
i
called
ye
delivered
me
not
out
of
their
and
when
i
saw
that
ye
delivered
i
put
my
life
in
my
and
passed
over
against
the
children
of
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
my
wherefore
then
are
ye
come
up
unto
me
this
to
fight
against

jephthah
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
and
fought
with
and
the
men
of

smote
because
they

the
men
of
gilead
said
unto
thou

manoah
her
husband
not
with

now
let
thy
words

i
pray
let

thou
must
offer

that
when
thy
sayings

on
their
faces
to

but
the
angel
of

did
no
more
appear
to
manoah
and
to
his
then
manoah
knew
that
he
an
angel
of
the
and
manoah
said
unto
his
we
shall
surely
because
we
have
seen
but
his
wife
said
unto
if
the
lord
were
pleased
to
kill
he
would
not
have
received
a
burnt
offering
and
a
meat
offering
at
our
neither
would
he
have
shewed
us
all
these
nor
would
as
at
this
time
have
told
us
as
and
the
woman
bare
a
and
called
his
name
and
the
child
and
the
lord
blessed
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
began
to
move
him
at
times
in
the
camp
of
dan
between
zorah
and
chapter
and
samson
went
down
to
and
saw
a
woman
in
timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
and
he
came
and
told
his
father
and
his
and
i
have
seen
a
woman
in
timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
now
therefore
get
her
for
me
to
then
his
father
and
his
mother
said
unto
never
a
woman
among
the
daughters
of
thy
or
among
all
my
that
thou
goest
to
take
a
wife
of
the
uncircumcised
and
samson
said
unto
his
get
her
for
for
she
pleaseth
me
but
his
father
and
his
mother
knew
not
that
it
of
the
that
he
sought
an
occasion
against
the
for
at
that
time
the
philistines
had
dominion
over
then
went
samson
and
his
father
and
his
to
and
came
to
the
vineyards
of
a
young
lion
roared
against

the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
mightily
upon
and
he
rent
him
as
he
would
have
rent
a
and
nothing
in
his
but
he
told
not
his
father
or
his
mother
what
he
had
and
he
went
and
talked
with
the
and
she
pleased
samson
and
after
a
time
he
returned
to

before
eli
the
now
the
sons
of

sons
of

not
the
and
the
custom
with
the

when
any

fleshhook
of
three
teeth
in
his
and
he
struck
into
the
or
or
or
all
that
the
fleshhook
brought
up
the

took
for
so
they
did
in
shiloh
unto
all
the
israelites
that
came
also
before
they
burnt
the
the
servant
and
said
to
the
man
that
give
flesh
to
roast
for
the
for
he
will
not
have
sodden
flesh
of
but
and
any
man
said
unto
let
them
not
fail
to
burn
the
fat
and
take
as
thy
soul
then
he
would
answer
but
thou
shalt
give
and
if
i
will
take
by
wherefore
the
sin
of
the
young
men
was
very
great
before
the
for
men
abhorred
the
offering
of
the
but
samuel
ministered
before

a
girded
with
a
linen
moreover
his
mother
made
him
a
little
and
brought
to
him
from
year
to
when
she
came
up
with
her
husband
to
offer
the

eli
blessed
elkanah
and
his
and
the
lord
give
thee
seed
of
this
woman
for
the
loan
which

lent
to

and
they
went
unto
their
own
and
the
lord
visited
so
that
she
and
bare
three
sons
and
two
and
the
child
samuel
grew
before
the
now
eli
was
very
and
heard
all
that
his
sons
did
unto
all
and
how
they
lay
with
the
women
that
assembled
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
and
he
said
unto
why
do
ye
such
for
i
hear
of
your
evil
dealings
by
all
this
my
for
no
good
report
that
i
ye
make
the
people
to
if
one
man
sin
against
the
judge
shall
judge
but
if
a
man
sin
against
the
who
shall
intreat
for
notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
their
because
the
lord
would
slay
and
the
child
samuel
grew
and
was
in
favour
both
with
the
and
also
with

there
came
a
man
of
god
unto
and
said
unto
thus
saith
the
did
i
plainly
appear
unto
the
house
of
thy
when
they
were
in
egypt
in
and
did
i
choose
him
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
my
to
offer
upon
mine
to
burn
to
wear
an
ephod
before
and
did
i
give
unto
the
house
of
thy
father
all
the
offerings
made
by
fire
of
the
children
of
wherefore
kick
ye
at
my
sacrifice
and
at
mine
which
i
have
commanded
and
honourest
thy
sons
above
to
make
yourselves
fat
with
the
chiefest
of
all
the
offerings
of
israel
my
wherefore
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
said
indeed
thy
and
the
house
of
thy
should
walk
before
me
for
but
now
the
lord
be
it
far
from
for
them
that
honour
me
i
will
and
they
that
despise
me
shall
be
lightly
the
days
that
i
will
cut
off
thine
and
the
arm
of
thy
that
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
and
thou
shalt
see
an
enemy
in
all
which
shall
give
and
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house
for
and
the
man
of
i
shall
not
cut
off
from
mine
to
consume
thine
and
to
grieve
thine
and
all
the
increase
of
thine
house
shall
die
in
the
flower
of
their
and
this
a
sign
unto
that
shall
come
upon
thy
two
on
hophni
and
in
one
day
they
shall
die
both
of
and
i
will
raise
me
up
a
faithful
shall
do
according
to
which
in
mine
heart
and
in
my
and
i
will
build
him
a
sure
and
he
shall
walk
before
mine
anointed
for
and
it
shall
come
to
every
one
that
is
left
in
thine
house
shall
come
crouch
to
him
for
a
piece
of
silver
and
a
morsel
of
and
shall
put
i
pray
into
one
of

i
may
eat
a
piece
of

therefore
i
have
sworn
unto

and
saul
the
son
of

when
they
sought

therefore
they
enquired
of
the
lord
if
the
man
should
yet
come
and
the
lord
he
hath
hid
himself
among
the
and
they
ran
and
fetched

and
when
he
stood
among

he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people
from
his
shoulders
and
and
samuel
said
to
all
the
see
ye
him
whom
the
lord
hath
that
none
like
him
among
all
the

all

samuel
told
the
people
the
manner
of
the
and
wrote
in
a
and
laid
up
before

samuel
sent
all
the
people
every
man
to
his
and
saul
also
went
home
to
and
there
went
with
him
a
band
of
whose
hearts
god
had
but
the
children
of
belial
how
shall
this
man
save
and
they
despised
and
brought
him
no
but
he
held
his
chapter
then
nahash
the
ammonite
came
and
encamped
against
and
all
the
men
of
jabesh
said
unto
make
a
covenant
with

we
will
serve
and
nahash
the
ammonite
answered
on
this
will
i
make
with
that
i
may
thrust
out
all
your
right
and
lay
it
a
reproach
upon
all
and
the
elders
of
jabesh
said
unto
give
us
seven
that
we
may
send
messengers
unto
all
the
coasts
of
and
if
no
man
to
save
we
will
come
out
to
then
came
the
messengers
to
gibeah
of
and
told
the
tidings
in
the
ears
of
the
and
all
the
people
lifted
up
their
and
saul
came
after
the
herd
out
of
the
and
saul
what
the
people
that
they
and
they
told
him
the
tidings
of
the
men
of
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
saul
when
he
heard
those
and
his
anger
was
kindled
and
he
took
a
yoke
of
and
hewed
them
in
and
sent
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
by
the
hands
of
whosoever
cometh
not
forth
after
saul
and
after
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
his
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
fell
on
the
and
they
came
out
with
one
and
when
he
numbered
them
in
the
children
of
israel
were
three
hundred
and
the
men
of
judah
thirty

they
said
unto
the
messengers
that
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
the
men
of

we
will
come
out
unto

ye
shall
do
with
us
all
that
seemeth
good
unto

it
was
on
the
that
saul
put
the
people
in
three
and
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
host
in
the
morning
and
slew
the
ammonites
until
the
heat
of
the
and
it
came
to
that
they
which
remained

so
that
two
of
them

the
people
said
unto
who
he
that

saul
reign
over
bring

that
we
may
put
them
to

saul
there
shall
not
a
man
be
put
to
death
this
for
to
day
the
lord

they
sacrificed

all
and
would
not
utterly
destroy
but
every
thing
vile
and
that
they
destroyed
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
it
repenteth
me
that
i
have
set
up
saul
for
he
is
turned
back
from
following
and
hath
not
performed
my
and
it
grieved
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
all
and
when
samuel
rose
early
to
meet
saul
in
the
it
was
told
saul
came
to
he
set
him
up
a
and
is
gone

gone
down
to

samuel
came
to

saul
said
unto
blessed
thou
of

have
performed
the
commandment
of
the
and
samuel
what
then
this
bleating
of
the
sheep
in
mine
and
the
lowing
of
the
oxen
which
i
and
saul
they
have
brought
them
from
the
for
the
people
spared
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
thy
and
the
rest
we
have
utterly
then
samuel
said
unto
and
i
will
tell
thee
what
the
lord
hath
said
to
me
this
and
he
said
unto

and
samuel
when
thou
little
in
thine
own
thou
not
the
head
of

anointed
thee
king
over
and
the
lord
sent
thee
on
a
and
go
and
utterly
destroy
the
sinners
the
and
fight
against
them
until
they
be
wherefore
then
didst
thou
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
but
didst
fly
upon
the
and
didst
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
and
saul
said
unto
i
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
and
have
gone
the
way
which
the
lord
sent
and
have
brought
agag
the
king
of
and
have
utterly
destroyed
the
but
the
people
took
of
the
sheep
and
the
chief
of
the
things
which
should
have
been
utterly
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
thy
god
in
and
samuel
hath
the
lord
delight
in
burnt
offerings
and
as
in
obeying
the
voice
of
the
to
obey
better
than
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
for
rebellion
the
sin
of
and
stubbornness
iniquity
and
because
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
he
hath
also
rejected
thee
from
and
saul
said
unto
i
have
for
i
have
transgressed
the
commandment
of
the
and
thy
because
i
feared
the
and
obeyed
their
now
i
pray
pardon
my
and
turn
again
with
that
i
may
worship
the
and
samuel
said
unto
i
will
not
return
with
for
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
and
the
lord
hath
rejected
thee
from
being
king
over
and
as
samuel
turned
about
to
go
he
laid
hold
upon
the
skirt
of
his
and
it
and
samuel
said
unto
the
lord
hath
rent
the
kingdom
of
israel
from
thee
this
and
hath
given
it
to
a
neighbour
of
better
than
and
also
the
strength
of
israel
will
not
lie
nor
for
he
not
a
that
he
should
then
he
i
have
honour
me
i
pray
before
the
elders
of
my
and
before
and
turn
again
with
that
i
may
worship
the
lord
thy
so
samuel
turned
again
after
and
saul
worshipped
the
then
said
bring
ye
hither
to
me
agag
the
king
of
the
and
agag
came
unto
him
and
agag
surely
the
bitterness
of
death
is
and
samuel
as
thy
sword
hath
made
women
so
shall
thy
mother
be
childless
among
and
samuel
hewed
agag
in
pieces
before
the
lord
in
then
samuel
went
to
and
saul
went
up
to
his
house
to
gibeah
of
and
samuel
came
no
more
to
see
saul
until
the
day
of
his
nevertheless
samuel
mourned
for
and
the
lord
repented
that
he
had
made
saul
king
over
chapter
and
the
lord
said
unto
how
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
seeing
i
have
rejected
him
from
reigning

fill
thine
horn
with
and
i
will
send
thee
to
jesse
the
for
i
have
provided
me
a
king
among
his
and
samuel
how
can
i
if
saul
hear
he
will
kill
and
the
lord
take
an
heifer
with
and
i
am
come
to

to
the
and
i
will
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
and
thou
shalt
anoint
unto
me
whom
i
name
unto
and
samuel
did
that
which
the
lord
and
came
to
and
the
elders
of
the
town
trembled
at
his
and
comest
thou
and
he
i
am
come
to

unto
the
sanctify
and
come
with
me
to
the

he
sanctified
jesse
and
his
and
called
them
to
the
and
it
came
to
when
they
were
that
he
looked
on
and
surely
the

before
but
the
lord
said
unto

height
of
his
because
i
have
refused

looketh
on
the
outward
but
the
lord
looketh
on
the

jesse
called
and
made
him
pass
before
and
he
neither

the
lord
chosen
then
jesse
made
shammah
to
pass
and
he
neither
hath
the
lord
chosen
jesse
made
seven
of
his
sons
to
pass
before
and
samuel
said
unto
the
lord

not
chosen
and
samuel
said
unto

all
and
he
there
remaineth
yet

the
midst
of
his
and
the

with
a
and
smote

david
and
stood
upon

took

drew
it
out
of
the
sheath
and
slew
and
cut
off
his
head
and
when
the
philistines
saw
their
champion
was
they
and
the
men
of
israel
and
of
judah
and
and
pursued
the
until
thou
come
to
the
and
to
the
gates
of

the
wounded
of
the
philistines
fell
down
by
the
way
to
even
unto

unto
and
the
children
of
israel
returned
from
chasing
after
the
and
they
spoiled
their
and
david
took
the
head
of
the
and
brought
it
to
but
he
put
his
armour
in
his
and
when
saul
saw
david
go
forth
against
the
he
said
unto
the
captain
of
the
whose
son
this
and
abner
thy
soul
o
i
cannot
and
the
king
enquire
thou
whose
son
the
stripling
and
as
david
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
abner
took
and
brought
him
before
saul
with
the
head
of
the
philistine
in
his
and
saul
said
to
whose
son
young
and
david
i
the
son
of
thy
servant
jesse
the
chapter
and
it
came
to
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
that
the
soul
of
jonathan
was
knit
with
the
soul
of
and
jonathan
loved
him
as
his
own
and
saul
took
him
that
and
would
let
him
go
no
more
home
to
his
then
jonathan
and
david
made
a
because
he
loved
him
as
his
own
and
jonathan
stripped
himself
of
the
robe
that
upon
and
gave
it
to
and
his
even
to
his
and
to
his
and
to
his
and
david
went
out
whithersoever
saul
sent
behaved
himself
and
saul
set
him
over
the
men
of
and
he
was
accepted
in
the
sight
of
all
the
and
also
in
the
sight
of
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
when
david
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
that
the
women
came
out
of
all
cities
of
singing
and
to
meet
king
with
with
and
with
instruments
of
and
the
women
answered
as
they
and
saul
hath
slain
his
and
david
his
ten
and
saul
was
very
and
the
saying
displeased
and
he
they
have
ascribed
unto
david
ten
and
to
me
they
have
ascribed
and
can
he
have
more
but
the
and
saul
eyed
david
from
that
day
and
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
the
evil
spirit
from
god
came
upon
and
he
prophesied
in
the
midst
of
the
and
david
played
with
his
as
at
other
and
a
javelin
in
and
saul
cast
the
for
he
i
will
smite
david
even
to
the
wall
and
david
avoided
out
of
his
presence
and
saul
was
afraid
of
because
the
lord
was
with
and
was
departed
from
therefore
saul
removed
him
from
and
made
him
his
captain
over
a
and
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
the
and
david
behaved
himself
wisely
in
all
his
and
the
lord
with
wherefore
when
saul
saw
that
he
behaved
himself
very
he
was
afraid
of
but
all
israel
and
judah
loved
because
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
and
saul
said
to
behold
my
elder
daughter
her
will
i
give
thee
to
only
be
thou
valiant
for
and
fight
the
for
saul
let
not
mine
hand
be
upon
but
let
the
hand
of
the
philistines
be
upon
and
david
said
unto
who
and
what
my
my
family
in
that
i
should
be
son
in
law
to
the
but
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
when
merab
daughter
should
have
been
given
to
that
she
was
given
unto
adriel
the
meholathite
to
and
michal
daughter
loved
and
they
told
and
the
thing
pleased
and
saul
i
will
give
him
that
she
may
be
a
snare
to
and
that
the
hand
of
the
philistines
may
be
against
wherefore
saul
said
to
thou
shalt
this
day
be
my
son
in
law
in
one
the
and
saul
commanded
his
commune
with
david
and
the
king
hath
delight
in
and
all
his
servants
love
now
therefore
be
the
son
in
and
servants
spake
those
words
in
the
ears
of
and
david
seemeth
it
to
you
light
to
be
a
son
in
seeing
that
i
a
poor
and
lightly
and
the
servants
of
saul
told
on
this
manner
spake
and
saul
thus
shall
ye
say
to
the
king
desireth
not
any
but
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
to
be
avenged
of
the
but
saul
thought
to
make
david
fall
by
the
hand
of
the
and
when
his
servants
told
david
these
it
pleased
david
well
to
be
the
son
in
and
the
days
were
not
wherefore
david
arose
and
he
and
his
and
slew
of
the
philistines
two
hundred
and
david
brought
their
and
they
gave
them
in
full
tale
to
the
that
he
might
be
the
son
in
and
saul
gave
him
michal
his
daughter
to
and
saul
saw
and
knew
that
the
lord
with
and
michal
daughter
loved
and
saul
was
yet
the
more
afraid
of
and
saul
became
enemy
then
the
princes
of
the
philistines
went
and
it
came
to
after
they
went
david
behaved
himself
more
wisely
than
all
the
servants
of
so
that
his
name
was
much
set
chapter
and
saul
spake
to
jonathan
his
and
to
all
his
that
they
should
kill
but
jonathan
son
delighted
much
in
and
jonathan
told
saul
my
father
seeketh
to
kill
now
i
pray
take
heed
to
thyself
until
the
and
abide
in
a
secret
and
hide
and
i
will
go
out
and
stand
beside
my
father
in
the
field
where
thou
and
i
will
commune
with
my
father
of
and
what
i
that
i
will
tell
and
jonathan
spake
good
of
david
unto
saul
his
and
said
unto
let
not
the
king
sin
against
his
against
because
he
hath
not
sinned
against
and
because
his
works
to
very
for
he
did
put
his
life
in
his
and
slew
the
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
salvation
for
all
thou
sawest
and
didst
wherefore
then
wilt
thou
sin
against
innocent
to
slay
david
without
a
and
saul
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
and
saul
the
lord
he
shall
not
be
and
jonathan
called
and
jonathan
shewed
him
all
those
and
jonathan
brought
david
to
and
he
was
in
his
as
in
times
and
there
was
war
and
david
went
and
fought
with
the

slew
them
with
a
great
and
they
fled
from
and
the
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
was
upon
as
he
sat
in
his
house
with
his
javelin
in
his
and
david
played
with
and
saul
sought
to
smite
david
even
to
the
wall
with
the
but
he
slipped
away
out
of

he
smote
the
javelin
into
the
and
david
and
escaped
that
saul
also
sent
messengers
unto
to
watch
and
to
slay
him
in
the
and
michal
wife
told
if
thou
save
not
thy
life
to

be
so
michal
let
david
down
through
a
and
he
and
and
and
michal
took
an
and
laid
in
the
and
put
a
pillow
of
for
his
and
covered
with
a
and
when
saul
sent
messengers
to
take
she
he
and
saul
sent
the
messengers
to
see
bring
him
up
to
me
in
the
that
i
may
slay
and
when
the
messengers
were
come
an
image
in
the
with
a
pillow
of
for
his
and
saul
said
unto
why
hast
thou
deceived
me
and
sent
away

that
he
is

michal
answered
he
said
unto

david
and
and
came
to
samuel
to
and
told
him
all
that
saul
had
done
to
and
he
and
samuel
went
and
dwelt
in
and
it
was
told
david
at
naioth
in
and
saul
sent
messengers
to
take
and
when
they
saw
the
company
of
the
prophets
and
samuel
standing
appointed
over
the
spirit
of
god
was
upon
the
messengers
of
and
they
also
and
when
it
was
told
he
sent
other
and
they
prophesied
and
saul
sent
messengers
again
the
third
and
they
prophesied
then
went
he
also
to
and
came
to
a
great
well
that
in
and
he
asked
and
where
samuel
and
and
at
naioth
in

he
went
thither
to

in
and
the
spirit
of

and
he
went
and
until
he
came
to

in
and
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
prophesied
before
samuel
in
like
and
lay
down
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
wherefore
they
saul
also
among
the
chapter
and
david
fled
from
naioth
in
and
came
and
said
before
what
have
i
what
mine
and
what
my
sin
before
thy
that
he
seeketh
my
and
he
said
unto
god
thou
shalt
not
my
father
will
do
nothing
either
great
or
but
that
he
will
shew
it
and
why
should
my
father
hide
this
thing
from
it
not
and
david
sware
and
thy
father
certainly
knoweth
that
i
have
found
grace
in
thine
and
he
let
not
jonathan
know
lest
he
be
but
truly
the
lord
and
thy
soul
but
a
step
between
me
and
then
said
jonathan
unto
whatsoever
thy
soul
i
will
even
do
for
and
david
said
unto
to
morrow
the
new
and
i
should
not
fail
to
sit
with
the
king
at
but
let
me
that
i
may
hide
myself
in
the
field
unto
the
third
at
if
thy
father
at
all
miss
then
david
earnestly
asked
of
me
that
he
might
run
to
his
for
a
yearly
sacrifice
there
for
all
the
if
he
say
thy
servant
shall
have
but
if
he
be
very
be
sure
that
evil
is
determined
by
therefore
thou
shalt
deal
kindly
with
thy
for
thou
hast
brought
thy
servant
into
a
covenant
of
the
lord
with
if
there
be
in
me
slay
me
for
why
shouldest
thou
bring
me
to
thy
and
jonathan
far
be
it
from
for
if
i
knew
certainly
that
evil
were
determined
by
my
father
to
come
upon
then
would
not
i
tell
it
then
said
david
to
who
shall
tell
or
what
thy
father
answer
thee
and
jonathan
said
unto
and
let
us
go
out
into
the
and
they
went
out
both
of
them
into
the
and
jonathan
said
unto
o
lord
god
of
when
i
have
sounded
my
father
about
to
morrow
any
the
third
there
good
toward
and
i
then
send
not
unto
and
shew
it
the
lord
do
so
and
much
more
to
but
if
it
please
my
father
thee
then
i
will
shew
it
and
send
thee
that
thou
mayest
go
in
and
the
lord
be
with
as
he
hath
been
with
my
and
thou
shalt
not
only
while
yet
i
live
shew
me
the
kindness
of
the
that
i
die
but
thou
shalt
not
cut
off
thy
kindness
from
my
house
for
not
when
the
lord
hath
cut
off
the
enemies
of
david
every
one
from
the
face
of
the
so
jonathan
made
with
the
house
of
let
the
lord
even
require
at
the
hand
of
and
jonathan
caused
david
to
swear
because
he
loved
for
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
his
own
then
jonathan
said
to
to
morrow
the
new
and
thou
shalt
be
because
thy
seat
will
be
and
thou
hast
stayed
three
thou
shalt
go
down
and
come
to
the
place
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
when
the
business
was
and
shalt
remain
by
the
stone
and
i
will
shoot
three
arrows
on
the
side
as
though
i
shot
at
a
i
will
send
a
find
out
the
if
i
expressly
say
unto
the
the
arrows
on
this
side
of
take
then
come
for
peace
to
and
no
the
lord
but
if
i
say
thus
unto
the
young
the
arrows
beyond
go
thy
for
the
lord
hath
sent
thee
and
the
matter
which
thou
and
i
have
spoken
the
lord
between
thee
and
me
for
so
david
hid
himself
in
the
and
when
the
new
moon
was
the
king
sat
him
down
to
eat
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
as
at
other
upon
a
seat
by
the
and
jonathan
and
abner
sat
by
and
place
was
nevertheless
saul
spake
not
any
thing
that
for
he
something
hath
befallen
he
not
surely
he
not
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
the
second
of
the
that
place
was
and
saul
said
unto
jonathan
his
wherefore
cometh
not
the
son
of
jesse
to
neither
nor
to
and
jonathan
answered
david
earnestly
asked
of
me
to
and
he
let
me
i
pray
for
our
family
hath
a
sacrifice
in
the
and
my
he
hath
commanded
me
be
and
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thine
let
me
get
i
pray
and
see
my
therefore
he
cometh
not
unto
the
then
anger
was
kindled
against
and
he
said
unto
thou
son
of
the
perverse
rebellious
do
not
i
know
that
thou
hast
chosen
the
son
of
jesse
to
thine
own
and
unto
the
confusion
of
thy
for
as
long
as
the
son
of
jesse
liveth
upon
the
thou
shalt
not
be
nor
thy
wherefore
now
send
and
fetch
him
unto
for
he
shall
surely
and
jonathan
answered
saul
his
and
said
unto
wherefore
shall
he
be
what
hath
he
and
saul
cast
a
javelin
at
him
to
smite
whereby
jonathan
knew
that
it
was
determined
of
his
father
to
slay
so
jonathan
arose
from
the
table
in
fierce
and
did
eat
no
meat
the
second
day
of
the
for
he
was
grieved
for
because
his
father
had
done
him
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
that
jonathan
went
out
into
the
field
at
the
time
appointed
with
and
a
little
lad
with
and
he
said
unto
his
find
out
now
the
arrows
which
i
as
the
lad
he
shot
an
arrow
beyond
and
when
the
lad
was
come
to
the
place
of
the
arrow
which
jonathan
had
jonathan
cried
after
the
and
not
the

david
and
cut
off
the
skirt
of

that
heart
smote
because

he
said
unto
his
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
do
this
thing
unto
my
the
to
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
seeing

david
stayed
his

rose
up
out

cried
after
my

said
to

hearest
thou
david
seeketh
thy
this
day
thine

have
seen
how
that
the
lord
had
delivered
thee
to
day
into
mine
hand
in
the
and
bade
kill
but
spared
and
i
i
will
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
my
for
he
the
my
see
the
skirt
of
thy
robe
in
my
for
in
that
i
cut
off
the
skirt
of
thy
and
killed
thee
know
thou
and
see
that
neither
evil
nor
transgression
in
mine
and
i
have
not
sinned
against
yet
thou
huntest
my
soul
to
take
the
lord
judge
between
me
and
and
the
lord
avenge
me
of
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
as
saith
the
proverb
of
the
wickedness
proceedeth
from
the
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
after
whom

therefore
be
and
judge
between
me
and

plead
my
and
deliver
me
out
of
thine
and
it
came
to
when
david
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
unto
that
saul
this
thy
my
son
and
saul
lifted
up
his
and
and
he
said
to
thou
more
righteous
than

hast
rewarded
me
whereas

have
rewarded
thee

hast
shewed
this
day
how
that

hast
dealt
well
with

had
delivered
me
into
thine
thou
killedst
me
for
if
a
man
find
his
will
he
let
him
go
well
wherefore
the
lord
reward
thee
good
for
that
thou
hast
done
unto
me
this
and
i
know
well
that
thou
shalt
surely
be

be
established
in
thine

therefore
unto
me
by

not
the

now
this
blessing
which
thine

brought
unto
my

it
even
be
given
unto
the

that
follow
my
i
pray
forgive
the
trespass
of
thine

grief
unto

offence
of
heart
unto
my
either
that
thou
hast
shed

david
said
in
his
i
shall
now
perish
one
day
by
the
hand
of
nothing
better
for
me
than
that
i
should
speedily
escape
into
the
land
of
the
and
saul
shall
despair
of
to
seek
me
any
more
in
any
coast
of
so
shall
i
escape
out
of
his

the
six
hundred
men
that

him
unto
the
son
of
king
of

david
dwelt
with
achish
at

david
with
his
two
ahinoam

and
abigail
the
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
fled
to
and
he
sought
no
more
again
for
and
david
said
unto
if
i
have
now
found
grace
in
thine
let
them
give
me
a
place
in
some
town
in
the
that
i
may
dwell
for
why
should
thy
servant
dwell
in
the
royal
city
with
then
achish
gave
him
ziklag
that
wherefore
ziklag
pertaineth
unto
the
kings
of
judah
unto
this
and
the
time
that
david
dwelt
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
was
a
full
year
and
four
and
david
and
his
men
went
and
invaded
the
and
the
and
the
for
those
of
old
the
inhabitants
of
the
as
thou
goest
to
even
unto
the
land
of
and
david
smote
the
and
left
neither
man
nor
woman
and
took
away
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
and
and
came
to
and
achish
whither
have
ye
made
a
road
to
and
david
against
the
south
of
and
against
the
south
of
the
and
against
the
south
of
the
and
david
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
to
bring
to
lest
they
should
tell
on
so
did
and
so
his
manner
all
the
while
he
dwelleth
in
the
country
of
the
and
achish
believed
he
hath
made
his
people
israel
utterly
to
abhor
therefore
he
shall
be
my
servant
for
chapter
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
that
the
philistines
gathered
their
armies
together
for
to
fight
with
and
achish
said
unto
know
thou
that
thou
shalt
go
out
with
me
to
thou
and
thy
and
david
said
to
surely
thou
shalt
know
what
thy
servant
can
and
achish
said
to
therefore
will
i
make
thee
keeper
of
mine
head
for
now
samuel
was
and
all
israel
had
lamented
and
buried
him
in
even
in
his
own
and
saul
had
put
away
those
that
had
familiar
and
the
out
of
the
and
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
and
came
and
pitched
in
and
saul
gathered
all
israel
and
they
pitched
in
and
when
saul
saw
the
host
of
the
he
was
and
his
heart
greatly
and
when
saul
enquired
of
the
the
lord
answered
him
neither
by
nor
by
nor
by
then
said
saul
unto
his
seek
me
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
that
i
may
go
to
and
enquire
of
and
his
servants
said
to
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
at
and
saul
disguised
and
put
on
other
and
he
and
two
men
with
and
they
came
to
the
woman
by
and
he
i
pray
divine
unto
me
by
the
familiar
and
bring
me
whom
i
shall
name
unto
and
the
woman
said
unto
thou
knowest
what
saul
hath
how
he
hath
cut
off
those
that
have
familiar
and
the
out
of
the
wherefore
then
layest
thou
a
snare
for
my
to
cause
me
to
and
saul
sware
to
her
by
the
the
lord
there
shall
no
punishment
happen
to
thee
for
this
then
said
the
whom
shall
i
bring
up
unto
and
he
bring
me
up
and
when
the
woman
saw
she
cried
with
a
loud
and
the
woman
spake
to
why
hast
thou
deceived
for
thou
and
the
king
said
unto
be
not
for
what
sawest
and
the
woman
said
unto
i
saw
gods
ascending
out
of
the
and
he
said
unto
what
form
he
and
she
an
old
man
cometh
and
he
covered
with
a
and
saul
perceived
that
it
and
he
stooped
with
face
to
the
and
bowed
and
samuel
said
to
why
hast
thou
disquieted
to
bring
me
and
saul
i
am
sore
for
the
philistines
make
war
against
and
god
is
departed
from
and
answereth
me
no
neither
by
nor
by
therefore
i
have
called
that
thou
mayest
make
known
unto
me
what
i
shall
then
said
wherefore
then
dost
thou
ask
of
seeing
the
lord
is
departed
from
and
is
become
thine
and
the
lord
hath
done
to
as
he
spake
by
for
the
lord
hath
rent
the
kingdom
out
of
thine
and
given
it
to
thy
to
because
thou
obeyedst
not
the
voice
of
the
nor
executedst
his
fierce
wrath
upon
therefore
hath
the
lord
done
this
thing
unto
thee
this
moreover
the
lord
will
also
deliver
israel
with
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
and
to
morrow
thou
and
thy
sons
with
the
lord
also
shall
deliver
the
host
of
israel
into
the
hand
of
the
then
saul
fell
straightway
all
along
on
the
and
was
sore
because
of
the
words
of
and
there
was
no
strength
in
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread
all
the
nor
all
the
and
the
woman
came
unto
and
saw
that
he
was
sore
and
said
unto
thine
handmaid
hath
obeyed
thy
and
i
have
put
my
life
in
my
and
have
hearkened
unto
thy
words
which
thou
spakest
unto
now
i
pray
hearken
thou
also
unto
the
voice
of
thine
and
let
me
set
a
morsel
of
bread
before
and
that
thou
mayest
have
when
thou
goest
on
thy
but
he
and
i
will
not
but
his
together
with
the
compelled
and
he
hearkened
unto
their
so
he
arose
from
the
and
sat
upon
the
and
the
woman
had
a
fat
calf
in
the
and
she
and
killed
and
took
and
kneaded
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
and
she
brought
before
and
before
his
and
they
did
then
they
rose
and
went
away

chapter
now
the
philistines
gathered
together
all
their
armies
to
and
the
israelites
pitched
by
a
fountain
which
in
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
passed
on
by

david
and
his
men
passed
on
in
the
rereward
with

the
princes
of

have
found
no
fault
in
him
since
he
fell
unto
this
and
the
princes
of
the
philistines
were
wroth
with
and
the
princes
of
the
philistines
said
unto

this
fellow
that
he
may
go
again
to
his
place
which
thou
hast
appointed
and
let
him
not
go
down
with

to
lest
in
the
battle
he
be
an
adversary
to

wherewith
should
he
reconcile
himself

the
great
spoil
that
they

not
a

all
the
elders
of
israel
came
to
the
king
to
and
king
david
made
a
league
with
them
in
hebron
before

and
david
perceived
that
the
lord
had
established
him
king
over

that
he
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
his
people
and
david
took
more
concubines
and
wives
out
of

he
was
come
from

there
were
yet
sons
and
daughters
born

david
heard
and
went
down
to
the
the
philistines

came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of

david
enquired
of
the
shall

go
up
to
the
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
and
the
lord
said
unto
go
for
i
will
doubtless
deliver
the
philistines
into
thine
and
david
came
to
and
david
smote
them
and
the
lord
hath
broken
forth
upon
mine
enemies
before
as
the
breach
of
therefore
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
and
there
they
left
their
and
david
and
his
men
burned
and
the
philistines
came
up
yet
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
and
when
david
enquired
of
the
he
thou
shalt
not
go
fetch
a
compass
behind
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
and
let
it
when
thou
hearest
the
sound
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
that
then
thou
shalt
bestir
for
then
shall
the
lord
go
out
before
to
smite
the
host
of
the
and
david
did
as
the
lord
had
commanded
and
smote
the
philistines
from
geba
until
thou
come
to
chapter
david
gathered
together
all
chosen
of
thirty
and
david
and
went
with
all
the
people
that
with
him
from
baale
of
to
bring
up
from
thence
the
ark
of
whose
name
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
that
dwelleth
the
and
they
set
the
ark
of
god
upon
a
new
and
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
that
in
and
uzzah
and
the
sons
of
drave
the
new
and
they
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
which
at
accompanying
the
ark
of
and
ahio
went
before
the
and
david
and
all
the
house
of
israel
played
before
the
lord
on
all
manner
of
made
fir
even
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
when
they
came
to
uzzah
put
forth
to
the
ark
of
and
took
hold
of
for
the
oxen

and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
and
god
smote
him
there
for
and
there
he
died
by
the
ark
of
and
david
was
because
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
upon
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
to
this
and
david
was
afraid
of
the
lord
that
and
how
shall
the
ark
of
the
lord
come
to
so
david
would
not
remove
the
ark
of
the
lord
unto
him
into
the
city
of
but
david
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
the
and
the
ark
of
the
lord
continued
in
the
house
of
the
gittite
three
and
the
lord
blessed
and
all
his
and
it
was
told
king
the
lord
hath
blessed
the
house
of
and
all
that
unto
because
of
the
ark
of
so
david
went
and
brought
up
the
ark
of
god
from
the
house
of
into
the
city
of
david
with
and
it
was
that
when
they
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
lord
had
gone
six
he
sacrificed
oxen
and
and
david
danced
before
the
lord
with
all
and
david
girded
with
a
linen
so
david
and
all
the
house
of
israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
with
and
with
the
sound
of
the
and
as
the
ark
of
the
lord
came
into
the
city
of
michal
daughter
looked
through
a
and
saw
king
david
leaping
and
dancing
before
the
and
she
despised
him
in
her
and
they
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
and
set
it
in
his
in
the
midst
of
the
tabernacle
that
david
had
pitched
for
and
david
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
and
as
soon
as
david
had
made
an
end
of
offering
burnt
offerings
and
peace
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
and
he
dealt
among
all
the
among
the
whole
multitude
of
as
well
to
the
women
as
to
every
one
a
cake
of
and
a
good
piece
and
a
flagon
so
all
the
people
departed
every
one
to
his
then
david
returned
to
bless
his
and
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
came
out
to
meet
and
how
glorious
was
the
king
of
israel
to
who
uncovered
himself
to
day
in
the
eyes
of
the
handmaids
of
his
as
one
of
the
vain
fellows
shamelessly
uncovereth
and
david
said
unto
before
the
which
chose
me
before
thy
and
before
all
his
to
appoint
me
ruler
over
the
people
of
the
over
therefore
will
i
play
before
the
and
i
will
yet
be
more
vile
than
and
will
be
base
in
mine
own
and
of
the
maidservants
which
thou
hast
spoken
of
them
shall
i
be
had
in
therefore
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
had
no
child
unto
the
day
of
her
chapter
and
it
came
to
when
the
king
sat
in
his
and
the
lord
had
given
him
rest
round
about
from
all
his

the
king
said
unto
nathan

the
ark
of
god
dwelleth
within
and
nathan
said
to
the
do
all
that
in
thine
for
the
lord
with
and
it
came
to
pass
that
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
go
and
tell
my
servant
thus
saith
the
shalt
thou
build

have
not
dwelt

since
the
time
that
i
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of

to
this
but
have
walked
in
a
tent
and
in
a
in
all
wherein
i
have
walked
with
all
the
children
of
israel

i
a
word

any
of
the
tribes
of
whom
i
commanded
to
feed
my
people
why

a
great
like

in
the
moreover
i
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
and
will
plant
that
they
may
dwell
in
a
place
of
their
and
move
no
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
afflict
them
any
as
and
as
since
the
time
that
i
commanded
judges
over
my
people
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
also
the
lord
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
and
when
thy
days
be
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy

will
set
up
thy
seed
after
which

proceed
out
of
thy

i
will
establish

shall
build
an
house
for
my
and
i
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for

he
shall
be
my
if
he
commit
i
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
of

with
the
stripes
of
the
children
of
but
my
mercy

did
nathan
speak
unto

went
king
david
and
sat
before

and
he
who
o

and
what
my
that
thou
hast
brought

thou
hast
spoken
also
of
thy
house
for
a
great
while

when

demanded
how

how
the

and
david
said
to

and
wash
thy
and
uriah
departed
out
of
the
and
there
followed
him
a
mess
from

but
uriah
slept
at
the
door
of
the
house
with
all
the
servants
of
his
and
went
not
down
to
his
and
when
they
had
told
uriah
went
not
down
unto
his
david
said
unto
camest
thou
not
from
why
didst
thou
not
go
down
unto

and
uriah
said
unto
the
and
and
abide
in
and
my
lord
and
the
servants
of
my
are
encamped
in
the
open
shall

then
go
into
mine
to
eat
and
to
and
to
lie
with
my
thou
and
thy
soul
i
will
not
do
this
and
david
said
to
tarry
here
to
day
and
to
morrow
i
will
let
thee
so
uriah
abode
in
jerusalem
that
and
the
and
when
david
had
called
he
did
eat
and
drink
before
and
he
made
him
and
at
even
he
went
out
to
lie
on
his
bed
with
the
servants
of
his
but
went
not
down
to
his
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
that
david
wrote
a
letter
to
and
sent
by
the
hand
of
and
he
wrote
in
the
set
ye
uriah
in
the
forefront
of
the
hottest
and
retire
ye
from
that
he
may
be
and
and
it
came
to
when
joab
observed
the
that
he
assigned
uriah
unto
a
place
where
he
knew
that
valiant
men
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
and
fought
with
and
there
fell
of
the
people
of
the
servants
of
and
uriah
the
hittite
died
then
joab
sent
and
told
david
all
the
things
concerning
the
and
charged
the
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
telling
the
matters
of
the
war
unto
the
and
if
so
be
that
the
wrath
and
he
say
unto
wherefore
approached
ye
so
nigh
unto
the
city
when
ye
did
knew
ye
not
that
they
would
shoot
from
the
who
smote
abimelech
the
son
of
did
not
a
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
him
from
the
that
he
died
in
why
went
ye
nigh
the
then
say
thy
servant
uriah
the
hittite
is
dead
so
the
messenger
and
came
and
shewed
david
all
that
joab
had
sent
him
and
the
messenger
said
unto
surely
the
men
prevailed
against
and
came
out
unto
us
into
the
and
we
were
upon
them
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
and
the
shooters
shot
from
off
the
wall
upon
thy
and
of
the
servants
be
and
thy
servant
uriah
the
hittite
is
dead
then
david
said
unto
the
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
let
not
this
thing
displease
for
the
sword
devoureth
one
as
well
as
make
thy
battle
more
strong
against
the
and
overthrow
and
encourage
thou
and
when
the
wife
of
uriah
heard
that
uriah
her
husband
was
she
mourned
for
her
and
when
the
mourning
was
david
sent
and
fetched
her
to
his
and
she
became
his
and
bare
him
a
but
the
thing
that
david
had
done
displeased
the
chapter
and
the
lord
sent
nathan
unto
and
he
came
unto
and
said
unto
there
were
two
men
in
one
the
one
and
the
other
the
rich
had
exceeding
many
flocks
and
but
the
poor
had
save
one
little
ewe
which
he
had
bought
and
nourished
and
it
grew
up
together
with
and
with
his
it
did
eat
of
his
own
and
drank
of
his
own
and
lay
in
his
and
was
unto
him
as
a
and
there
came
a
traveller
unto
the
rich
and
he
spared
to
take
of
his
own
flock
and
of
his
own
to
dress
for
the
wayfaring
man
that
was
come
unto
but
took
the
poor
and
dressed
it
for
the
man
that
was
come
to
and
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
the
and
he
said
to
the
lord
the
man
that
hath
done
this
shall
surely
and
he
shall
restore
the
lamb
because
he
did
this
and
because
he
had
no
and
nathan
said
to
thou
the
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
i
anointed
thee
king
over
and
i
delivered
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
and
i
gave
thee
thy
and
thy
wives
into
thy
and
gave
thee
the
house
of
israel
and
of
and
if
had
too
i
would
moreover
have
given
unto
thee
such
and
such
wherefore
hast
thou
despised
the
commandment
of
the
to
do
evil
in
his
thou
hast
killed
uriah
the
hittite
with
the
and
hast
taken
his
wife
thy
and
hast
slain
him
with
the
sword
of
the
children
of
now
therefore
the
sword
shall
never
depart
from
thine
because
thou
hast
despised
and
hast
taken
the
wife
of
uriah
the
hittite
to
be
thy
thus
saith
the
i
will
raise
up
evil
against
thee
out
of
thine
own
and
i
will
take
thy
wives
before
thine
and
give
unto
thy
and
he
shall
lie
with
thy
wives
in
the
sight
of
this
for
thou
didst
but
i
will
do
this
thing
before
all
and
before
the
and
david
said
unto
i
have
sinned
against
the
and
nathan
said
unto
the
lord
also
hath
put
away
thy
thou
shalt
not
because
by
this
deed
thou
hast
given
great
occasion
to
the
enemies
of
the
lord
to
the
child
also
born
unto
thee
shall
surely
and
nathan
departed
unto
his
and
the
lord
struck
the
child
that
wife
bare
unto
and
it
was
very
david
therefore
besought
god
for
the
and
david
and
went
and
lay
all
night
upon
the
and
the
elders
of
his
house
to
to
raise
him
up
from
the
but
he
would
neither
did
he
eat
bread
with
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
that
the
child
and
the
servants
of
david
feared
to
tell
him
that
the
child
was
for
they
while
the
child
was
yet
we
spake
unto
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
our
how
will
he
then
vex
if
we
tell
him
that
the
child
is
but
when
david
saw
that
his
servants
david
perceived
that
the
child
was
therefore
david
said
unto
his
is
the
child
and
they
he
is
then
david
arose
from
the
and
and
anointed
and
changed
his
and
came
into
the
house
of
the
and
then
he
came
to
his
own
and
when
he
they
set
bread
before
and
he
did
then
said
his
servants
unto
what
thing
this
that
thou
hast
thou
didst
fast
and
weep
for
the
it
but
when
the
child
was
thou
didst

such
thing
ought
to
be
done
in
do
not
thou
this
and
whither
shall
i
cause
my
shame
to
and
as
for
thou
shalt
be
as
one
of
the
fools
in
now
i
pray
speak
unto
the
for
he
will
not
withhold
me
from
howbeit
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
being
stronger
than
forced
and
lay
with
then
amnon
hated
her
so
that
the
hatred
wherewith
he
hated
her
greater
than
the
love
wherewith
he
had
loved
and
amnon
said
unto
be
and
she
said
unto
no
this
evil
in
sending
me
away
greater
than
the
other
that
thou
didst
unto
but
he
would
not
hearken
unto
then
he
called
his
servant
that
ministered
unto
and
put
now
this
out
from

bolt
the
door
after
and
a
garment
of
divers
colours
upon
for
with
such
robes
were
the

virgins
then
his
servant
brought
her

bolted
the
door
after

tamar
put
ashes
on
her
and
rent
her
garment
of
divers
colours
that
on

laid
her
hand
on

her
brother
said
unto
hath
amnon
thy
brother
been

but
hold
now
thy
my
he
thy
regard
not
this
so
tamar
remained
desolate
in
her
brother
but
when
king
david
heard
of
all
these
he
was
very
and
absalom
spake
unto
his
brother
amnon
neither
good
nor
for
absalom
hated
because
he
had
forced
his
sister
and
it
came
to
pass
after
two
full
that
absalom
had
sheepshearers
in
which
beside
and
absalom
invited
all
the
and
absalom
came
to
the
and
behold
thy
servant

his
servants

the
king
said
to
my
let

be
chargeable
unto

he
pressed
howbeit
he
would
not
but
blessed

pray
let
my
brother
amnon

the
king
said
unto
why
should
he
go
with
but
absalom
pressed
that
he
let
amnon
and
all
the

joab
arose
and
went
to
and
brought
absalom
to
and
the
king
let
him
turn
to
his
own
and
let
him
not
see
my
so
absalom
returned
to
his
own
and
saw
not
the
but
in
all
israel
there
was
none
to
be
so
much
praised
as
absalom
for
his
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
even
to
the
crown
of
his
head
there
was
no
blemish
in
and
when
he
polled
his
it
was
at
every
end
that
he
polled
because
was
heavy
on
therefore
he
polled
he
weighed
the
hair
of
his
head
at
two
hundred
shekels
after
the
and
unto
absalom
there
were
born
three
and
one
whose
name
she
was
a
woman
of
a
fair
so
absalom
dwelt
two
full
years
in
and
saw
not
the
therefore
absalom
sent
for
to
have
sent
him
to
the
but
he
would
not
come
to
and
when
he
sent
again
the
second
he
would
not
therefore
he
said
unto
his
field
is
near
and
he
hath
barley
go
and
set
it
on
and
servants
set
the
field
on
then
joab
and
came
to
absalom
unto
and
said
unto
wherefore
have
thy
servants
set
my
field
on
and
absalom
answered
i
sent
unto
come
that
i
may
send
thee
to
the
to
wherefore
am
i
come
from
had
good
for
me
have
there
now
therefore
let
me
see
the
and
if
there
be
iniquity
in
let
him
kill
so
joab
came
to
the
and
told
and
when
he
had
called
for
he
came
to
the
and
bowed
himself
on
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
and
the
king
kissed
chapter
and
it
came
to
pass
after
that
absalom
prepared
him
chariots
and
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
and
absalom
rose
up
and
stood
beside
the
way
of
the
and
it
was
that
when
any
man
that
had
a
controversy
came
to
the
king
for
then
absalom
called
unto
and
of
what
city
and
he
thy
servant
of
one
of
the
tribes
of
and
absalom
said
unto
thy
matters
good
and
but
no
man
of
the
king
to
hear
absalom
said
oh
that
i
were
made
judge
in
the
that
every
man
which
hath
any
suit
or
cause
might
come
unto
and
i
would
do
him
and
it
was
that
when
any
man
came
nigh
to
do
him
he
put
forth
his
and
took
and
kissed
and
on
this
manner
did
absalom
to
all
israel
that
came
to
the
king
for
so
absalom
stole
the
hearts
of
the
men
of

it
came
to
pass
after
forty
that
absalom
said
unto

i
will
serve
the
and
the
king
said
unto

in
so
he
and
went
to

absalom
sent
spies
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
as
soon
as
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the

with
absalom
went
two

this
and
i
will
come

while
he
weary
and
weak
and
will
make
him
and
all
the
people
that
with
him
shall
and
i
will
smite
the

shall
we
do
his
if
speak
and
hushai
said
unto
the
counsel
that
ahithophel
hath
given
not
good
at
this
said
thou
knowest
thy
father
and
his
that
they
mighty
and
they
chafed
in
their
as
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
in
the
and
thy
father
a
man
of
and
will
not
lodge
with
the
he
is
hid
now
in
some
or
in
some
and
it
will
come
to
when
some
of
them
be
overthrown
at
the
that
whosoever
heareth
it
will
there
is
a
slaughter
among
the
people
that
follow
and
he
also
whose
heart
as
the
heart
of
a
shall
utterly
for
all
israel
knoweth
that
thy
father
a
mighty
and
which
with
him
valiant
therefore
i
counsel
that
all
israel
be
generally
gathered
unto
from
dan
even
to
as
the
sand
that
by
the
sea
for
and
that
thou
go
to
battle
in
thine
own
so
shall
we
come
upon
him
in
some
place
where
he
shall
be
and
we
will
light
upon
him
as
the
dew
falleth
on
the
and
of
him
and
of
all
the
men
that
with
him
there
shall
not
be
left
so
much
as
if
he
be
gotten
into
a
then
shall
all
israel
bring
ropes
to
that
and
we
will
draw
it
into
the
until
there
be
not
one
small
stone
found
and
absalom
and
all
the
men
of
israel
the
counsel
of
hushai
the
archite
better
than
the
counsel
of
for
the
lord
had
appointed
to
defeat
the
good
counsel
of

the
intent
that
the
lord
might
bring
evil
upon

said
hushai
unto
zadok
and
to
abiathar
the
thus
and
thus
did
ahithophel
counsel
absalom
and
the
elders
of

to
wherefore
then
be
ye
angry
for
this
have
we
eaten
at
all
of

or
hath
he
given
us
any
and
the
men
of
israel
answered
the
men
of
and
we
have
ten
parts
in
the
and
we
have
also
more
in
david
than
why
then
did
ye
despise
that
our
advice
should
not
be
first
had
in
bringing
back
our
and
the
words
of
the
men
of
judah
were
fiercer
than
the
words
of
the
men
of
chapter
and
there
happened
to
be
there
a
man
of
whose
name
the
son
of

and
he
blew
a
and
we
have
no
part
in
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the

so
every
man
of
israel
went
up
from

followed
sheba
the
son
of

the
men
of
judah
clave
unto
their
from

even
to

david
came
to
his
house
at
and
the
king
took
the
ten
women
whom
he
had
left
to
keep
the
and
put
them
in
and
fed
but
went
not
in
unto
so
they
were
shut
up
unto
the
day
of
their
living
in
then
said
the
king
to
assemble
me
the
men
of
judah
within
three
and
be
thou
here
so
amasa
went
to
assemble
men
but
he
tarried
longer
than
the
set
time
which
he
had
appointed
and
david
said
to
now
shall
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
do
us
more
harm
than
take
thou
thy
and
pursue
after
lest
he
get
him
fenced
and
escape
and
there
went
out
after
him
and
the
and
the
and
all
the
mighty
and
they
went
out
of
to
pursue
after
sheba
the
son
of
when
they
at
the
great
stone
which
in
amasa
went
before
and
garment
that
he
had
put
on
was
girded
unto
and
upon
it
a
girdle
a
sword
fastened
upon
his
loins
in
the
sheath
and
as
he
went
forth
it
fell
and
joab
said
to
thou
in
my
and
joab
took
amasa
by
the
beard
with
the
right
hand
to
kiss
but
amasa
took
no
heed
to
the
sword
that
in
so
he
smote
him
therewith
in
the
fifth
and
shed
out
his
bowels
to
the
and
struck
him
not
and
he
so
joab
and
abishai
his
brother
pursued
after
sheba
the
son
of
and
one
of
men
stood
by
and
he
that
favoureth
and
he
that
for
him
after
and
amasa
wallowed
in
blood
in
the
midst
of
the
and
when
the
man
saw
that
all
the
people
stood
he
removed
amasa
out
of
the
highway
into
the
and
cast
a
cloth
upon
when
he
saw
that
every
one
that
came
by
him
stood
when
he
was
removed
out
of
the
all
the
people
went
on
after
to
pursue
after
sheba
the
son
of
and
he
went
through
all
the
tribes
of
israel
unto
and
to
and
all
the
and
they
were
gathered
and
went
also
after
and
they
came
and
besieged
him
in
abel
of
and
they
cast
up
a
bank
against
the
and
it
stood
in
the
and
all
the
people
that
with
joab
battered
the
to
throw
it
then
cried
a
wise
woman
out
of
the
i
pray
unto

near
that

may
speak
with

when
he
was
come
near
unto
the
woman
thou
and
he
i
then
she
said
unto

the
words
of
thine
and
he
i
do
then
she
they
were
wont
to
speak
in
old
they
shall
surely
ask
at
and
so
they
ended
i
one
of
them
that
peaceable
faithful
in
thou
seekest
to
destroy
a
city
and
a
mother
in
why
wilt
thou
swallow
up
the
inheritance
of
the
and
joab
answered
and
far
be
far
be
it
from
that
i
should
swallow
up
or
the
matter

a
man
of

him
and
i
will
depart
from

and
the
woman
said
unto
his
head

thrown
to
thee
over
the
then
the
woman
went
unto
all
the
people
in
her
and
they
cut
off
the
head
of
sheba
the
son
of
and
cast
out
to

he
blew
a

they
retired
from

thou
saidst

the
king
said
moreover
to
thou
knowest
all
the
wickedness
which
thine
heart
is
privy
that
thou
didst

my
therefore
the
lord
shall
return
thy
wickedness
upon
thine
own
and
king
solomon
and
the
throne
of
david
shall
be
established
before
the

for
so
the

commanded
benaiah
the
son
of
which
went
and
fell
upon
that
he
and
the
kingdom
was
established
in
the
hand
of
chapter

solomon
made
affinity
with
pharaoh
king
of

took
and
brought
her
into
the
city
of
until
he
had
made
an
end
of
building
his
own
and
the
house
of
the
and
the
wall
of
jerusalem
round
only
the
people
sacrificed
in
high
because
there
was
no
house
built
unto
the
name
of

until
those
and
solomon
loved
the
walking
in
the
statutes
of
david
his
only
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
high
and
the
king
went
to
gibeon
to
sacrifice
for
that
the
great
high
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
did
solomon
offer
upon
that
in
gibeon
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
in
a
dream
by
and
god
ask
what
i
shall
give
and
solomon
thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
servant
david
my
father
great
according
as
he
walked
before
thee
in
and
in
and
in
uprightness
of
heart
with
and
thou
hast
kept
for
him
this
great
that
thou
hast
given
him
a
son
to
sit
on
his
as
this
and
o
lord
my
thou
hast
made
thy
servant
king
instead
of
david
my
and
i
a
little
i
know
not
to
go
out
or
come
and
thy
servant
in
the
midst
of
thy
people
which
thou
hast
a
great
that
cannot
be
numbered
nor
counted
for
give
therefore
thy
servant
an
understanding
heart
to
judge
thy
that
i
may
discern
between
good
and
for
who
is
able
to
judge
this
thy
so
great
a
and
the
speech
pleased
the
that
solomon
had
asked
this
and
god
said
unto
because
thou
hast
asked
this
and
hast
not
asked
for
thyself
long
neither
hast
asked
riches
for
nor
hast
asked
the
life
of
thine
but
hast
asked
for
thyself
understanding
to
discern
i
have
done
according
to
thy
i
have
given
thee
a
wise
and
an
understanding
so
that
there
was
none
like
thee
before
neither
after
thee
shall
any
arise
like
unto

i
have
also
given
thee
that
which
thou
hast
not
both
and
so
that
there
shall
not
be
any
among
the
kings
like
unto
thee
all
thy
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
as
thy
father
david
did
then
i
will
lengthen
thy
and
solomon

for
all
the
goodness
that
the
lord
had
done
for

his
and
for

his
chapter
and
it
came
to
when
solomon
had
finished
the
building
of
the
house
of
the
and
the
and
all
desire
which
he
was
pleased
to
that
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
the
second
as
he
had
appeared
unto
him
at
and
the
lord
said
unto
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
that
thou
hast
made
before
i
have
hallowed
this
which
thou
hast
to
put
my
name
there
for
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
as
david
thy
father
in
integrity
of
and
in
to
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
wilt
keep
my
statutes
and
my
then
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
as
i
promised
to
david
thy
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
upon
the
throne
of
if
ye
shall
at
all
turn
from
following
ye
or
your
and
will
not
keep
my
commandments
my
statutes
which
i
have
set
before
but
go
and
serve
other
and
worship
then
will
i
cut
off
israel
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
given
and
this
which
i
have
hallowed
for
my
will
i
cast
out
of
my
and
israel
shall
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
and
at
this
is
every
one
that
passeth
by
it
shall
be
and
shall
and
they
shall
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
and
to
this
and
they
shall
because
they
forsook
the
lord
their
who
brought
forth
their
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
and
have
taken
hold
upon
other
and
have
worshipped
and
served
therefore
hath
the
lord
brought
upon
them
all
this
and
it
came

of

they
pleased
him
and
he
what

these
which
thou
hast
given

he
called
them
the
land
of
cabul

this
and
hiram
sent

my
which
i

stirred
up
an
adversary
unto

and
certain
edomites
of
his

yet
a
little
and
they
arose
out
of

came
to

they
took
men
with
them
out
of

they
came
to
unto
pharaoh
king
of

gave
him
an

that
david
slept
with

that
joab
the
captain
of
the

said
to
let
me
that
i
may
go
to
mine

then
pharaoh
said
unto

what
hast
thou
lacked
with
thou
seekest
to

he
howbeit
let

god
stirred
him
up

he
gathered
men
unto

became
captain
over

when
david
slew
them
and
they
went
to
and
dwelt
and
reigned
in

he
was
an
adversary
to
israel
all
the
days
of
beside
the
mischief
that
hadad
and
he
abhorred
and
reigned
over

jeroboam
the
son
of
an
ephrathite
of
whose
name
a
widow
even
he
lifted
up

seeing
the
young
man
that
he
was
he
made
him
ruler
over
all
the
charge
of
the
house
of

it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
when
jeroboam
went
out
of

the
prophet
ahijah
the
shilonite
found
him
in

ahijah
caught
the
new
garment
that
on
and
rent
it

he
said
to
take
thee
ten
for
thus
saith
the
the
god
of
i
will
rend
the
kingdom
out
of

hand
of

will
give
ten
tribes

shall
have
one
tribe
for
my
servant
and
for
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
because
that
they
have
forsaken

have
worshipped
ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
chemosh
the
god
of
the
and
milcom
the
god
of
the
children
of

mine
and
my
statutes
and
my
as
david
his
howbeit
i
will
not
take
the
whole
kingdom
out
of
his
but
i
will
make
him
prince
all
the
days
of
his
life
for
david
my
whom

because
he
kept
my
commandments
and
my
but
i
will
take
the
kingdom
out
of
his
and
will
give
it
unto
ten
and
unto
his
son
will
i
give
one
that
david
my
servant
may
have
a
light
alway
before
me
in
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
me
to
put
my

thou
shalt
reign
according
to
all
that

built
for

will
give
israel
unto
and
i
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
of
but
not
for
solomon
sought
therefore
to
kill
and
jeroboam
and
fled
into
unto
shishak
king
of
and
was
in
egypt
until
the
death
of
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
and
all
that
he
and
his
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
acts
of
and
the
time
that
solomon
reigned
in
jerusalem
over
all
israel
forty
and
solomon
slept
with
his
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
his
and
rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
chapter
and
rehoboam
went
to
for
all
israel
were
come
to
shechem
to
make
him
and
it
came
to
when
jeroboam
the
son
of
who
was
yet
in
heard
he
was
fled
from
the
presence
of
king
and
jeroboam
dwelt
in
that
they
sent
and
called
and
jeroboam
and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spake
unto
thy
father
made
our
yoke
now
therefore
make
thou
the
grievous
service
of
thy
and
his
heavy
yoke
which
he
put
upon
and
we
will
serve
and
he
said
unto
depart
yet
three
then
come
again
to
and
the
people
and
king
rehoboam
consulted
with
the
old
that
stood
before
solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
and
how
do
ye
advise
that
i
may
answer
this
and
they
spake
unto
if
thou
wilt
be
a
servant
unto
this
people
this
and
wilt
serve
and
answer
and
speak
good
words
to
then
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
but
he
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
which
they
had
given
and
consulted
with
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
which
stood
before
and
he
said
unto
what
counsel
give
ye
that
we
may
answer
this
who
have
spoken
to
make
the
yoke
which
thy
father
did
put
upon
us
and
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
him
spake
unto
thus
shalt
thou
speak
unto
this
people
that
spake
unto
thy
father
made
our
yoke
but
make
thou
lighter
unto
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
little
shall
be
thicker
than
my
and
now
whereas
my
father
did
lade
you
with
a
heavy
i
will
add
to
your
my
father
hath
chastised
you
with
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
so
jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
rehoboam
the
third
as
the
king
had
come
to
me
again
the
third
and
the
king
answered
the
people
and
forsook
the
old
counsel
that
they
gave
and
spake
to
them
after
the
counsel
of
the
young
my
father
made
your
yoke
and
i
will
add
to
your
my
father
chastised
you
with
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
wherefore
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
for
the
cause
was
from
the
that
he
might
perform
his
which
the
lord
spake
by
ahijah
the
shilonite
unto
jeroboam
the
son
of
so
when
all
israel
saw
that
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
answered
the
what
portion
have
we
in
neither
inheritance
in
the
son
of
to
your
o
now
see
to
thine
own
so
israel
departed
unto
their
but
the
children
of
israel
which
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
rehoboam
reigned
over
then
king
rehoboam
sent
who
over
the
and
all
israel
stoned
him
with
that
he
therefore
king
rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
to
flee
to
so
israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
david
unto
this
and
it
came
to
when
all
israel
heard
that
jeroboam
was
come
that
they
sent
and
called
him
unto
the
and
made
him
king
over
all
there
was
none
that
followed
the
house
of
but
the
tribe
of
judah
and
when
rehoboam
was
come
to
he
assembled
all
the
house
of
with
the
tribe
of
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
which
were
to
fight
against
the
house
of
to
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
rehoboam
the
son
of
but
the
word
of
god
came
unto
shemaiah
the
man
of
speak
unto
the
son
of
king
of
and
unto
all
the
house
of
judah
and
and
to
the
remnant
of
the
thus
saith
the
ye
shall
not
go
nor
fight
against
your
brethren
the
children
of
return
every
man
to
his
for
this
thing
is
from
they
hearkened
therefore
to
the
word
of
the
and
returned
to

to
the
word
of
the
then
jeroboam
built
shechem
in
mount
and
dwelt
and
went
out
from

built
and
jeroboam
said
in
his
now
shall

return
to
the
house
of
if
this
people
go
up
to
do
sacrifice
in
the
house
of
the
lord
at
then
shall
the
heart
of
this
people
turn
again
unto
their
unto
rehoboam
king
of
and
they
shall
kill
and
go
again
to
rehoboam
king
of
whereupon
the
king
took
and
made
two
calves
and
said
unto
it
is
too
much
for
you
to
go
up
to
behold
thy

which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of

he
set

the
other
put
he
in

this
thing
became
a
for
the
people
went

he
made
an
house
of
high
and
made

he
offered

through
the
wilderness
of

the
king
of

poured
water
on
the
hands
of

jehoshaphat
the
word
of
the
lord
is
with
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
and
the
king
of
edom
went
down
to
and
elisha
said
unto
the
king

with
get
thee
to
the
prophets
of
thy
and
to
the
prophets
of
thy
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
for
the
lord
hath
called
these
three
kings
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
and
elisha
the
lord
of
hosts
before
whom
i
were
it
not
that
i
regard
the
presence
of
jehoshaphat

would
not
look
toward

came
upon

he
thus
saith
the
make
this
valley
full
of

is
a
light
thing
in
the
sight
of

there
came
water
by
the
way
of
and
the
country
was
filled
with
and
when
all
the
moabites
heard
that
the
kings
were
come
up
to
fight
against
they
gathered
all
that
were
able
to
put
on
and
and
stood
in
the
and
they
rose
up
early
in
the
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
and
the
moabites
saw
the
water
on
the
other
side
red
as
and
they
this
the
kings
are
surely
and
they
have
smitten
one
now
to
the
and
when
they
came
to
the
camp
of
the
israelites
rose
up
and
smote
the

that
they
fled
before
but
they
went
forward
smiting

they
beat
down

when
the
king
of

saw
that
the
battle
was
too
sore
for
he
took
with
him
seven
hundred
men
that
drew
to
break
through
unto
the
king

but
they
could
then
he
took
his
eldest
son
that
should
have
reigned
in
his
and
offered
him
a
burnt
offering
upon
the

there
was
great
indignation
against

they
departed
from

a
light
thing
for

he
what

thine
and
hezekiah
all
that
in
mine
house

they
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
i
have
not
shewed

isaiah
said
unto

david
took
the
crown
of
their
king
from

found
it
to
weigh
a
talent
of

precious
stones
in

so
dealt
david
with
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
and
david
and
all
the
people
returned
to

it
came
to
pass
after
that
there
arose
war
at
gezer
with
the
at
which
time
sibbechai
the
hushathite
slew

six
each
and
six

when
he
defied
jonathan
the
son
of
shimea
brother
slew
these
were
born
unto
the
giant
in
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
and
by
the
hand
of
his
chapter
and
satan
stood
up
against
and
provoked
david
to
number
and
david
said
to
joab
and
to
the
rulers
of
the
number
israel
from
even
to
and
bring
the
number
of
them
to
that
i
may
know
and
joab
the
lord
make
his
people
an
hundred
times
so
many
more
as
they
my
lord
the
they
not
all
my
why
then
doth
my
lord
require
this
why
will
he
be
a
cause
of
trespass
to
nevertheless
the
word
prevailed
against
wherefore
joab
and
went
throughout
all
and
came
to
and
joab
gave
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
and
all
israel
were
a
thousand
thousand
and
an
hundred
thousand
men
that
drew
and
judah
four
hundred
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
that
drew
but
levi
and
benjamin
counted
he
not
among
for
the
word
was
abominable
to
and
god
was
displeased
with
this
therefore
he
smote
and
david
said
unto
i
have
sinned
because
i
have
done
this
but
i
beseech
do
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
for
i
have
done
very
and
the
lord
spake
unto
go
and
tell
thus
saith
the
i
offer
thee
three
choose
thee
one
of
that
i
may
do
unto
so
gad
came
to
and
said
unto
thus
saith
the
choose
thee
either
three
or
three
months
to
be
destroyed
before
thy
while
that
the
sword
of
thine
enemies
overtaketh
or
else
three
days
the
sword
of
the
even
the
in
the
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
destroying
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
now
therefore
advise
thyself
what
word
i
shall
bring
again
to
him
that
sent
and
david
said
unto
i
am
in
a
great
let
me
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
for
very
great
his
but
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
so
the
lord
sent
pestilence
upon
and
there
fell
of
israel
seventy
thousand
and
god
sent
an
angel
unto
jerusalem
to
destroy
and
as
he
was
the
lord
and
he
repented
him
of
the
and
said
to
the
angel
that
it
is
stay
now
thine
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
by
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
and
david
lifted
up
his
and
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
stand
between
the
earth
and
the
having
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
stretched
out
over
then
david
and
the
elders
who
clothed
in
fell
upon
their
and
david
said
unto
not
i
commanded
the
people
to
be
even
i
it
is
that

sinned
and
done
evil
but
these
what
have
they
let
thine
i
pray
o
lord
my
be
on
and
on
my
but
not
on
thy
that
they
should
be
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
commanded
gad
to
say
to
that
david
should
go
and
set
up
an
altar
unto
the
lord
in
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
and
david
went
up
at
the
saying
of
which
he
spake
in
the
name
of
the
and
ornan
turned
and
saw
the
and
his
four
sons
with
him
hid
now
ornan
was
threshing
and
as
david
came
to
ornan
looked
and
saw
and
went
out
of
the
and
bowed
himself
to
david
with
face
to
the
then
david
said
to
grant
me
the
place
of
that
i
may
build
an
altar
therein
unto
the
thou
shalt
grant
it
me
for
the
full
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
and
ornan
said
unto
take
to
and
let
my
lord
the
king
do
which
good
in
his
i
give
the
oxen
for
burnt
and
the
threshing
instruments
for
and
the
wheat
for
the
meat
i
give
it
and
king
david
said
to
but
i
will
verily
buy
it
for
the
full
for
i
will
not
take
which
thine
for
the
nor
offer
burnt
offerings
without
so
david
gave
to
ornan
for
the
place
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
by
and
david
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
and
called
upon
the
and
he
answered
him
from
heaven
by
fire
upon
the
altar
of
burnt
and
the
lord
commanded
the
and
he
put
up
his
sword
again
into
the
sheath
at
that
time
when
david
saw
that
the
lord
had
answered
him
in

to
enquire
of

was
afraid
because
of
the
sword
of

then
david

sanctified
this
that
my

mine
heart
shall
be

for
if
thou

before
as
david
thy

and
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded

as
i
have
covenanted
with
david
thy
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a

if
ye
turn

forsake
my
statutes
and
my
which
i
have
set
before

shall
go

serve
other
and
worship

i
pluck
them
up
by
the
roots
out
of
my
land
which
i
have
given
and
this
which
i
have
sanctified
for
my

cast
out
of

passeth
by
so
that
he
shall
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto

the
and
the
fear
of
god
was
on
all
the
kingdoms
of
when
they
had
heard
that
the
lord
fought
against
the
enemies
of

the
realm
of

and
they
written
in
the
book
of
jehu
the
son
of
who
mentioned
in

of
and
after
this
did
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
join
himself
with
ahaziah
king
of
who
did
very
and
he
joined
himself
with
him
to
make
ships
to
go
to
and
they
made
the
ships
in
then
eliezer
the

prophesied
against

thou
hast
joined
thyself
with
the
lord
hath
broken
thy
and
the
ships
were
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
to
chapter
now
jehoshaphat
slept
with

was
buried
with

all
these
the
sons
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
and
their
father
gave
them
great
gifts
of
and
of
and
of
precious
with
fenced
cities
in
but
the
kingdom
gave
he
to
because
he
the
now
when
jehoram
was
risen
up
to
the
kingdom
of
his
he
strengthened
and
slew
all
his
brethren
with

he
reigned
eight
years
in

he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
like
as
did
the
house
of
for
he
had
the
daughter
of
ahab
to
and
he
wrought
which
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
howbeit
the
lord
would
not
destroy
the
house
of
because
of
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
and
as
he
promised
to
give
a
light
to
him
and
to
his
sons
for
in
his
days
the
edomites
revolted
from
under
the
dominion
of
and
made
themselves
a
then
jehoram
went
forth
with
his
and
all
his
chariots
with

he
rose
up
by
and
smote
the
edomites
which
compassed
him

the
captains
of

the
edomites
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
unto
this
the
same
time
did
libnah
revolt
from

because
he
had
forsaken

moreover
he
made
high
places
in
the
mountains
of
and
caused
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
commit
and
compelled
judah
and
there
came
a
writing
to
him
from
elijah
the
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
david
thy
because
thou
hast
not
walked
in

thy
nor
in
the
ways
of
asa
king
of
but
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of

hast
made
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
go
a
like
to
the
whoredoms
of
the
house
of

also
hast
slain
thy

plague
will
the

smite
thy
and
thy
and
thy
and
all
thy
and
thou
great
sickness
by
disease
of
thy
until
thy
bowels
fall
out
by
reason
of
the
sickness
day
by
moreover
the
lord
stirred
up
against
jehoram
the
spirit
of
the
and
of
the
that
near
the
and
they
came
up
into
and
brake
into
and
carried
away
all
the
substance
that
was
found
in
the
and
his
sons
and
his
so
that
there
was
never
a
son
left
save
the
youngest
of
his
and
after
all
this
the
lord
smote
him
in
his
bowels
with
an
incurable
and
it
came
to
that
in
process
of
after
the
end
of
two
his
bowels
fell
out
by
reason
of
his
so
he
died
of
sore
and
his
people
made
no

also
walked
in
the

wherefore
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of

came
to
when

they
made
a
and
set
it
without
at
the
gate
of
the
house
of
the
and
they
made
a
proclamation
through
judah
and
to
bring
in
to
the
lord
the
collection
moses
the
servant
of
god
upon
israel
in
the
and
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
and
brought
and
cast
into
the
until
they
had
made
an
now
it
came
to
that
at
what
time
the
chest
was
brought
unto
the
office
by
the
hand
of
the
and
when
they
saw
that
much
the
scribe
and
the
high
officer
came
and
emptied
the
and
took
and
carried
it
to
his
place
thus
they
did
day
by
and
gathered
money
in
and
the
king
and
jehoiada
gave
it
to
such
as
did
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
and
hired
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
the
house
of
the
and
also
such
as
wrought
iron
and
brass
to
mend
the
house
of
the
so
the
workmen
and
the
work
was
perfected
by
and
they
set
the
house
of
god
in
his
and
strengthened
and
when
they
had
finished
they
brought
the
rest
of
the
money
before
the
king
and
whereof
were
made
vessels
for
the
house
of
the
vessels
to
and
to
offer
and
and
vessels
of
gold
and
and
they
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
house
of
the
lord
continually
all
the
days
of
but
jehoiada
waxed
and
was
full
of
days
when
he
an
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
when
he
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
among
the
because
he
had
done
good
in
both
toward
and
toward
his
now
after
the
death
of
jehoiada
came
the
princes
of
and
made
obeisance
to
the
then
the
king
hearkened
unto
and
they
left
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
their
and
served
groves
and
and
wrath
came
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
for
this
their
yet
he
sent
prophets
to
to
bring
them
again
unto
the
and
they
testified
against
but
they
would
not
give
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
zechariah
the
son
of
jehoiada
the
which
stood
above
the
and
said
unto
thus
saith
why
transgress
ye
the
commandments
of
the
that
ye
cannot
because
ye
have
forsaken
the
he
hath
also
forsaken
and
they
conspired
against
and
stoned
him
with
stones
at
the
commandment
of
the
king
in
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
thus
joash
the
king
remembered
not
the
kindness
which
jehoiada
his
father
had
done
to
but
slew
his
and
when
he
he
the
lord
look
upon
and
require
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
the
the
host
of
syria
came
up
against
and
they
came
to
judah
and
and
destroyed
all
the
princes
of
the
people
from
among
the
and
sent
all
the
spoil
of
them
unto
the
king
of
for
the
army
of
the
syrians
came
with
a
small
company
of
and
the
lord
delivered
a
very
great
host
into
their
because
they
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
their
so
they
executed
judgment
against
and
when
they
were
departed
from
they
left
him
in
great
his
own
servants
conspired
against
him
for
the
blood
of
the
sons
of
jehoiada
the
and
slew
him
on
his
and
he
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
but
they
buried
him
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
and
these
are
they
that
conspired
against
zabad
the
son
of
shimeath
an
and
jehozabad
the
son
of
shimrith
a
now
his
and
the
greatness
of
the
burdens
upon
and
the
repairing
of
the
house
of
they
written
in
the
story
of
the
book
of
the
and
amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
chapter
amaziah
twenty
and
five
years
old
he
began
to
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
and
his
name
jehoaddan
of
and
he
did
which
right
in
the
sight
of
the
but
not
with
a
perfect
now
it
came
to
when
the
kingdom
was
established
to
that
he
slew
his
servants
that
had
killed
the
king
his
but
he
slew
not
their
but
as
written
in
the
law
in
the
book
of
where
the
lord
the
fathers
shall
not
die
for
the
neither
shall
the
children
die
for
the
but
every
man
shall
die
for
his
own
moreover
amaziah
gathered
judah
and
made
them
captains
over
and
captains
over
according
to
the
houses
of
throughout
all
judah
and
and
he
numbered
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
and
found
them
three
hundred
thousand
choice
to
go
forth
to
that
could
handle
spear
and
he
hired
also
an
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
out
of
israel
for
an
hundred
talents
of
but
there
came
a
man
of
god
to
o
let
not
the
army
of
israel
go
with
for
the
lord
not
with
all
the
children
of
but
if
thou
wilt
do
be
strong
for
the
god
shall
make
thee
fall
before
the
for
god
hath
power
to
and
to
cast
and
amaziah
said
to
the
man
of
but
what
shall
we
do
for
the
hundred
talents
which
i
have
given
to
the
army
of
and
the
man
of
god
the
lord
is
able
to
give
thee
much
more
than
then
amaziah
separated
the
army
that
was
come
to
him
out
of
to
go
home
wherefore
their
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
and
they
returned
home
in
great
and
amaziah
strengthened
and
led
forth
his
and
went
to
the
valley
of
and
smote
of
the
children
of
seir
ten
and
ten
thousand
alive
did
the
children
of
judah
carry
away
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
of
the
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
that
they
all
were
broken
in
but
the
soldiers
of
the
army
which
amaziah
sent
that
they
should
not
go
with
him
to
fell
upon
the
cities
of
from
samaria
even
unto
and
smote
three
thousand
of
and
took
much
now
it
came
to
after
that
amaziah
was
come
from
the
slaughter
of
the
that
he
brought
the
gods
of
the
children
of
and
set
them
up
his
and
bowed
down
himself
before
and
burned
incense
unto
wherefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
and
he
sent
unto
him
a
which
said
unto
why
hast
thou
sought
after
the
gods
of
the
which
could
not
deliver
their
own
people
out
of
thine
and
it
came
to
as
he
talked
with

the

by
david
king
of

all
the

all
until
the
burnt
offering
was

when
they
had
made
an
end
of

and
all
that
were

with

bowed
and
moreover
hezekiah
the
king
and
the
princes
commanded
the
levites
to
sing
praise
unto

with
the
words
of
and
of

the
and
they
sang

then
hezekiah
answered
and
now
ye
have
consecrated
yourselves
unto
the
come
near
and
bring
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
and
the
congregation
brought
in
sacrifices
and
thank
and
as
many
as
were
of
a
free
heart
burnt
and
the
number
of
the
burnt
which
the
congregation
was
threescore
and
ten
an
hundred
two
hundred
all
these
for
a
burnt
offering
to
the
and
the
consecrated
things
six
hundred
oxen
and
three
thousand
but
the
priests
were
too
so
that
they
could
not
flay
all
the
burnt
wherefore
their
brethren
the
levites
did
help
till
the
work
was
and
until
the
priests
had
sanctified
for
the
levites
more
upright
in
heart
to
sanctify
themselves
than
the
and
also
the
burnt
offerings
in
with
the
fat
of
the
peace
and
the
drink
offerings
for
burnt
so
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
was
set
in
and
hezekiah
and
all
the
that
god
had
prepared
the
for
the
thing
was
chapter
and
hezekiah
sent
to
all
israel
and
and
wrote
letters
also
to
ephraim
and
that
they
should
come
to
the
house
of
the
lord
at
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
god
of
for
the
king
had
taken
and
his
and
all
the
congregation
in
to
keep
the
passover
in
the
second
for
they
could
not
keep
it
at
that
because
the
priests
had
not
sanctified
themselves
neither
had
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
to
and
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
all
the
so
they
established
a
decree
to
make
proclamation
throughout
all
from
even
to
that
they
should
come
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
at
for
they
had
not
done
of
a
long
in
such
as
it
was
so
the
posts
went
with
the
letters
from
the
king
and
his
princes
throughout
all
israel
and
and
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
ye
children
of
turn
again
unto
the
lord
god
of
and
and
he
will
return
to
the
remnant
of
that
are
escaped
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
and
be
not
ye
like
your
and
like
your
which
trespassed
against
the
lord
god
of
their
therefore
gave
them
up
to
as
ye
now
be
ye
not
as
your
fathers
yield
yourselves
unto
the
and
enter
into
his
which
he
hath
sanctified
for
and
serve
the
lord
your
that
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
may
turn
away
from
for
if
ye
turn
again
unto
the
your
brethren
and
your
children
compassion
before
them
that
lead
them
so
that
they
shall
come
again
into
this
for
the
lord
your
god
gracious
and
and
will
not
turn
away
face
from
if
ye
return
unto
so
the
posts
passed
from
city
to
city
through
the
country
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
even
unto
but
they
laughed
them
to
and
mocked
nevertheless
divers
of
asher
and
manasseh
and
of
zebulun
humbled
and
came
to
also
in
judah
the
hand
of
god
was
to
give
them
one
heart
to
do
the
commandment
of
the
king
and
of
the
by
the
word
of
the

took
away
the
altars
that
in
and
all
the

for
incense
took
they
and
cast
into
the
brook
then
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
of
the
second
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
were
and
sanctified
and
brought
in
the
burnt
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
and
they
stood
in
their
place
after
their

for
many
in
the
congregation
that

therefore
the
levites
had
the
charge
of
the
killing
of
the

for
every

not

a
multitude
of
the

of
and
and
had
not

yet
did
they
eat
the

otherwise
than

but
hezekiah
prayed
for
the
good

with

praised
the

by
with
loud
instruments
unto
the
and
hezekiah
spake
comfortably
unto
all
the
levites
that
taught
the
good
knowledge
of

they
did
eat
throughout
the

seven
offering
peace
and
making

to
the
lord
god
of
their
and
the
whole

took
counsel
to

they
kept

of

send
his

all
his
power
with
unto
hezekiah
king

unto
all
judah
that
at
thus
saith
sennacherib
king
of
whereon
do
ye
that
ye
abide
in
the
siege
in
doth
not
hezekiah
persuade
you
to
give
over
yourselves
to
die
by
famine
and
by
the
lord
our
god
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
hath
not
the

hezekiah
taken
away
his
high
places
and
his
and
commanded
judah
and
ye
shall
worship
before
one
and
burn
incense
upon
know
ye
not
what
i
and
my
fathers
have
done
unto
all
the
people
of
were
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
those
lands
any
ways
able
to
deliver
their
lands
out
of
mine
who
among
all
the
gods
of
those
nations
that
my
fathers
utterly
that
could
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
that
your
god
should
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
mine
now
therefore
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
nor
persuade
you
on
this
neither
yet
believe
for
no
god
of
any
nation
or
kingdom
was
able
to
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
and
out
of
the
hand
of
my
how
much
less
shall
your
god
deliver
you
out
of
mine
and
his
servants
spake
yet
against
the
lord
and
against
his

he
wrote
also
letters
to
rail
on
the
lord
god
of

to
speak
against
as
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
lands
have
not
delivered
their
people
out
of
mine
so
shall
not
the
god
of
hezekiah
deliver
his
people
out
of

then
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
speech
unto
the
people
of
jerusalem
that
on
the
to
affright
and
to
trouble
that
they
might
take
the
and
they
spake
against
the
god
of
as
against
the
gods
of
the
people
of
the
the
work
of
the
hands
of
and
for
this
hezekiah
the
and
the
prophet
isaiah
the
son
of
prayed
and
cried
to
and
the
lord
sent
an
which
cut
off
all
the
mighty
men
of
and
the
leaders
and
captains
in
the
camp
of
the
king

he
returned
with
shame
of

into
the
house
of
his
they
that
came
forth
of

that
he
was
magnified

hezekiah
was
sick
to
the

prayed
unto
the

he
spake
unto

he
gave
him
a

hezekiah
rendered
not
again
according
to
the
benefit
unto
for
his
heart
was
lifted
therefore
there
was
wrath
upon

upon
judah
and
notwithstanding
hezekiah
humbled
himself
for
the
pride
of
his
he
and
the
inhabitants
of
so
that
the
wrath
of
the
lord

exceeding
much
riches

increased
over
and
our
trespass
is
grown
up
unto
the
since

to
a
and
to
confusion
of
as
this

space
grace
hath
been
from

lord
our
to
leave
us
a
remnant
to
and
to
give
us
a
nail
in
his
holy
that
our
god
may
lighten
our
and
give
us
a
little
reviving
in
our
for
we
yet
our
god
hath
not
forsaken
us
in
our
but
hath
extended
mercy
unto
us
in
the
sight
of
the
kings
of
to
give
us
a
to
set
up
the
house
of
our
and
to
repair
the
desolations
and
to
give
us
a
wall
in
judah
and
in
and
o
our
what
shall
we
say
after
for
we
have
forsaken
thy
which
thou
hast
commanded
by
thy
servants
the
the
unto
which
ye
go
to
possess
is
an
unclean
land
with
the
filthiness
of
the
people
of

with
their
which
have
filled
it
from

end
to
another
with

therefore
give
not
your
daughters
unto
their
neither
take
their
daughters
unto
your
nor
seek
their
peace
or
their
wealth
for
that
ye
may
be

an
inheritance
to
your
children
for
and
after
all
that
is
come
upon
us
for
our
evil
and
for
our
great
seeing
that
thou
our
god
hast
punished
us
less
than
our
iniquities
and
hast
given
us
deliverance
as
should
we
again
break
thy
and
join
in
affinity
with
the
people
of
these
wouldest
not
thou
be
angry
with
us
till
thou
hadst
consumed
so
that

it
came
to
that
when
sanballat
heard
that
we
builded
the
he
was
and
took
great
and
mocked
the
and
he
spake
before
his

and
the
army
of
and
what
do
these
feeble
will
they
fortify
will
they
will
they
make
an
end
in
a
will
they
revive
the
stones
out
of

of
the
rubbish
which
are
now
tobiah
the
ammonite
by
and
he
even
that
which
they
if
a
fox
go
he
shall
even
break
down
their
stone
o
our
for
we
are
and
turn
their
reproach
upon
their
own
and
give
them
for
a
prey
in
the
land
of
and
cover
not
their
and
let
not
their
sin
be
blotted
out
from
before
for
they
have
provoked
to
anger
before
the
so
built
we
the
and
all
the
wall
was
joined
together
unto
the
half
for
the
people
had
a
mind
to
but
it
came
to
when
and
and
the
and
the
and
the
heard
that
the
walls
of
jerusalem
were
made
that
the
breaches
began
to
be
then
they
were
very
and
conspired
all
of
them
together
to
come
to
fight
against
and
to
hinder
nevertheless
we
made
our
prayer
unto
our
and
set
a
watch
against
them
day
and
because
of
and
judah
the
strength
of
the
bearers
of
burdens
is
and
much
so
that
we
are
not
able
to
build
the
and
our
adversaries
they
shall
not
neither
till
we
come
in
the
midst
among
and
slay
and
cause
the
work
to
and
it
came
to
that
when
the
jews
which
dwelt
by
them
they
said
unto
us
ten
from
all
places
whence
ye
shall
return
unto
us
will
be
upon
therefore
set
i
in
the
lower
places
behind
the
on
the
higher
i
even
set
the
people
after
their
families
with
their
their
and
their
and
i
and
rose
and
said
unto
the
and
to
the
and
to
the
rest
of
the
be
not
ye
afraid
of
remember
the
great
and
and
fight
for
your
your
and
your
your
and
your
and
it
came
to
when
our
enemies
heard
that
it
was
known
unto
and
god
had
brought
their
counsel
to
that
we
returned
all
of
us
to
the
every
one
unto
his
and
it
came
to
pass
from
that
time
the
half
of
my
servants
wrought
in
the
and
the
other
half
of
them
held
both
the
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
rulers
behind
all
the
house
of
they
which
builded
on
the
and
they
that
bare
with
those
that
with
one
of
his
hands
wrought
in
the
and
with
the
other
held
a
for
the
every
one
had
his
sword
girded
by
his
and
and
he
that
sounded
the
trumpet
by
and
i
said
unto
the
and
to
the
and
to
the
rest
of
the
the
work
great
and
and
we
are
separated
upon
the
one
far
from
in
what
place
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
resort
ye
thither
unto
our
god
shall
fight
for
so
we
laboured
in
the
and
half
of
them
held
the
spears
from
the
rising
of
the
morning
till
the
stars
likewise
at
the
same
time
said
i
unto
the
let
every
one
with
his
servant
lodge
within
that
in
the
night
they
may
be
a
guard
to
and
labour
on
the
so
neither
nor
my
nor
my
nor
the
men
of
the
guard
which
followed
none
of
us
put
off
our
every
one
put
them
off
for
chapter
and
there
was
a
great
cry
of
the
people
and
of
their
wives
against
their
brethren
the
for
there
were
that
our
and
our
therefore
we
take
up
corn
that
we
may
and
also
there
were
that
we
have
mortgaged
our
and
that
we
might
buy
because
of
the
there
were
also
that
we
have
borrowed
money
for
the
that
our
lands
and
yet
now
our
flesh
as
the
flesh
of
our
our
children
as
their
we
bring
into
bondage
our
sons
and
our
daughters
to
be
and
of
our
daughters
are
brought
unto
bondage
neither
in
our
power
redeem
for
other
men
have
our
lands
and
and
i
was
very
angry
when
i
heard
their
cry
and
these
then
i
consulted
with
and
i
rebuked
the
and
the
and
said
unto
ye
exact
every
one
of
his
and
i
set
a
great
assembly
against
and
i
said
unto
we
after
our
ability
have
redeemed
our
brethren
the
which
were
sold
unto
the
and
will
ye
even
sell
your
or
shall
they
be
sold
unto
then
held
they
their
and
found
nothing
also
i
it
not
good
that
ye
ought
ye
not
to
walk
in
the
fear
of
our
god
because
of
the
reproach
of
the
heathen
our
i
my
and
my
might
exact
of
them
money
and
i
pray
let
us
leave
off
this
i
pray
to
even
this
their
their
their
and
their
also
the
hundredth
of
the
and
of
the
the
and
the
that
ye
exact
of
then
said
we
will
restore
and
will
require
nothing
of
so
will
we
do
as
thou
then
i
called
the
and
took
an
oath
of
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
also
i
shook
my
and
so
god
shake
out
every
man
from
his
and
from
his
that
performeth
not
this
even
thus
be
he
shaken
and
and
all
the
congregation
and
praised
the
and
the
people
did
according
to
this
moreover
from
the
time
that
i
was
appointed
to
be
their
governor
in
the
land
of
from
the
twentieth
year
even
unto
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
artaxerxes
the
twelve
i
and
my
brethren
have
not
eaten
the
bread
of
the
but
the
former
governors
that
before
me
were
chargeable
unto
the
and
had
taken
of
them
bread
and
beside
forty
shekels
of
even
their
servants
bare
rule
over
the
but
so
did
not
because
of
the
fear
of
also
i
continued
in
the
work
of
this
neither
bought
we
any
and
all
my
servants
gathered
thither
unto
the
moreover
at
my
table
an
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
jews
and
beside
those
that
came
unto
us
from
among
the
heathen
that
about
now
which
was
prepared
daily
one
ox
six
choice
also
fowls
were
prepared
for
and
once
in
ten
days
store
of
all
sorts
of
yet
for
all
this
required
not
i
the
bread
of
the
because
the
bondage
was
heavy
upon
this
think
upon
my
for
to
all
that
i
have
done
for
this
chapter
now
it
came
to
when
and
and
geshem
the
and
the
rest
of
our
heard
that
i
had
builded
the
and
there
was
no
breach
left
at
that
time
i
had
not
set
up
the
doors
upon
the
that
sanballat
and
geshem
sent
unto
let
us
meet
together
in
one
the
villages
in
the
plain
of
but
they
thought
to
do
me
and
i
sent
messengers
unto
i
doing
a
great
so
that
i
cannot
come
why
should
the
work
whilst
i
leave
and
come
down
to
yet
they
sent
unto
me
four
times
after
this
and
i
answered
them
after
the
same
then
sent
sanballat
his
servant
unto
me
in
like
manner
the
fifth
time
with
an
open
letter
in
his
wherein
it
is
reported
among
the
and
gashmu
saith
thou
and
the
jews
think
to
for
which
cause
thou
buildest
the
that
thou
mayest
be
their
according
to
these
and
thou
hast
also
appointed
prophets
to
preach
of
thee
at
a
king
in
and
now
shall
it
be
reported
to
the
king
according
to
these
come
now
and
let
us
take
counsel
then
i
sent
unto
there
are
no
such
things
done
as
thou
but
thou
feignest
them
out
of
thine
own
for
they
all
made
us
their
hands
shall
be
weakened
from
the
that
it
be
not
now
strengthen
my
afterward
i
came
unto
the
house
of
shemaiah
the
son
of
delaiah
the
son
of
who
shut
and
he
let
us
meet
together
in
the
house
of
within
the
and
let
us
shut
the
doors
of
the
for
they
will
come
to
slay
in
the
night
will
they
come
to
slay
and
i
should
such
a
man
as
i
and
who
as
i
would
go
into
the
temple
to
save
his
i
will
not
go
i
perceived
that
god
had
not
sent
but
that
he
pronounced
this
prophecy
against
for
tobiah
and
sanballat
had
hired
therefore
he
that
i
should
be
and
do
and
and
they
might
have
for
an
evil
that
they
might
reproach
my
think
thou
upon
tobiah
and
sanballat
according
to
these
their
and
on
the
prophetess
and
the
rest
of
the
that
would
have
put
me
in
so
the
wall
was
finished
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
of
in
fifty
and
two
and
it
came
to
that
when
all
our
enemies
heard
and
all
the
heathen
that
about
us
saw
they
were
much
cast
down
in
their
own
for
they
perceived
that
this
work
was
wrought
of
our
moreover
in
those
days
the
nobles
of
judah
sent
many
letters
unto
and
of
tobiah
came
unto
for
many
in
judah
sworn
unto
because
he
the
son
in
law
of
shechaniah
the
son
of
and
his
son
johanan
had
taken
the
daughter
of
meshullam
the
son
of
also
they
reported
his
good
deeds
before
and
uttered
my
words
to
tobiah
sent
letters
to
put
me
in
chapter
now
it
came
to
when
the
wall
was
and
i
had
set
up
the
and
the
porters
and
the
singers
and
the
levites
were
that
i
gave
my
brother
and
hananiah
the
ruler
of
the
charge
over
for
he
a
faithful
and
feared
god
above
and
i
said
unto
let
not
the
gates
of
jerusalem
be
opened
until
the
sun
be
and
while
they
stand
let
them
shut
the
and
bar
and
appoint
watches
of
the
inhabitants
of
every
one
in
his
and
every
one
over
against
his
now
the
city
large
and
but
the
people
few
and
the
houses
not
and
my
god
put
into
mine
heart
to
gather
together
the
and
the
and
the
that
they
might
be
reckoned
by
and
i
found
a
register
of
the
genealogy
of
them
which
came
up
at
the
and
found
written
these
the
children
of
the
that
went
up
out
of
the
of
those
that
had
been
carried
whom
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
had
carried
and
came
again

shewedst
signs
and
wonders
upon

on
all
his
and
on
all
the
people
of
his
for
thou
knewest
that
they
dealt
proudly
against

thou
get
thee
a

didst
divide
the
sea
before
so
that
they
went
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
on

dry
and
their
persecutors
thou
threwest

that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
thou
hadst
sworn
to
give
but
they
and
our
fathers
dealt
and
hardened
their
and
hearkened
not
to
thy
and
refused
to
neither
were
mindful
of
thy
wonders
that
thou
didst
among
but
hardened
their
and
in
their
rebellion
appointed
a
captain
to
return
to
their
but
thou
a
god
ready
to
gracious
and
slow
to
and
of
great
and
forsookest
them
when
they
had
made
them
a
molten
and
this
thy
god
that
brought
thee
up
out
of
and
had
wrought
great
yet
thou
in
thy
manifold
mercies
forsookest
them
not
in
the
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
departed
not
from
them
by
to
lead
them
in
the
neither
the
pillar
of
fire
by
to
shew
them
and
the
way
wherein
they
should
thou
gavest
also
thy
good
spirit
to
instruct
and
withheldest
not
thy
manna
from
their
and
gavest
them
water
for
their
forty
years
didst
thou
sustain
them
in
the
they
lacked
their
clothes
waxed
not
and
their
feet
swelled
moreover
thou
gavest
them
kingdoms
and
and
didst
divide
them
into
so
they
possessed
the
land
of
and
the
land
of
the
king
of
and
the
land
of
og
king
of
their
children
also
multipliedst
thou
as
the
stars
of
and
broughtest
them
into
the
concerning
which
thou
hadst
promised
to
their
that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
so
the
children
went
in
and
possessed
the
and
thou
subduedst
before
them
the
inhabitants
of
the
the
and
gavest
them
into
their
with
their
and
the
people
of
the
that
they
might
do
with
them
as
they
and
they
took
strong
and
a
fat
and
possessed
houses
full
of
all
wells
and
and
fruit
trees
in
so
they
did
and
were
and
became
and
delighted
themselves
in
thy
great
nevertheless
they
were
and
rebelled
against
and
cast
thy
law
behind
their
and
slew
thy
prophets
which
testified
against
them
to
turn
them
to
and
they
wrought
great
therefore
thou
deliveredst
them
into
the
hand
of
their
who
vexed
and
in
the
time
of
their
when
they
cried
unto
thou
heardest
from
and
according
to
thy
manifold
mercies
thou
gavest
them
who
saved
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
but
after
they
had
they
did
evil
again
before
therefore
leftest
thou
them
in
the
hand
of
their
so
that
they
had
the
dominion
over
yet
when
they
and
cried
unto
thou
heardest
from
and
many
times
didst
thou
deliver
them
according
to
thy
and
testifiedst
against
that
thou
mightest
bring
them
again
unto
thy
yet
they
dealt
and
hearkened
not
unto
thy
but
sinned
against
thy
if
a
man
he
shall
live
in
and
withdrew
the
and
hardened
their
and
would
not
yet
many
years
didst
thou
forbear
and
testifiedst
against
them
by
thy
spirit
in
thy
yet
would
they
not
give
therefore
gavest
thou
them
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
nevertheless
for
thy
great
sake
thou
didst
not
utterly
consume
nor
forsake
for
thou
a
gracious
and
merciful
now
our
the

testify
against

not
served
thee
in
their
and
in
thy
great
goodness
that
thou
gavest

the

was
his
wrath
because
he
justified
himself
rather
than
also
against
his
three
friends
was
his
wrath
because
they
had
found
no

elihu
had
waited

had
because
they
elder

his
wrath
was

that

striketh
them
as
wicked

for
he
established

in
and
appointed
a

in
which
he
commanded
our
that
they
should
make
them
known
to
their
that
the
generation
to
come
might
know
the
children
should
be
should
arise
and
declare
to
their
that
they
might
set
their
hope
in
and
not
forget
the
works
of
but
keep
his
and
might
not
be
as
their
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
a
generation
set
not
their
heart
and
whose
spirit
was
not
stedfast
with
the
children
of
carrying
turned
back
in
the
day
of
they
kept
not
the
covenant
of
and
refused
to
walk
in
his
and
forgat
his
and
his
wonders
that
he
had
shewed
marvellous
things
did
he
in
the
sight
of
their
in
the
land
of
the
field
of
he
divided
the
and
caused
them
to
pass
and
he
made
the
waters
to
stand
as
an
in
the
daytime
also
he
led
them
with
a
and
all
the
night
with
a
light
of
he
clave
the
rocks
in
the
and
gave
drink
as
the
great
he
brought
streams
also
out
of
the
and
caused
waters
to
run
down
like
and
they
sinned
yet
more
against
him
by
provoking
the
most
high
in
the
and
they
tempted
god
in
their
heart
by
asking
meat
for
their
they
spake
against
they
can
god
furnish
a
table
in
the
he
smote
the
that
the
waters
gushed
and
the
streams
can
he
give
bread
can
he
provide
flesh
for
his
therefore
the
lord
heard
and
was
so
a
fire
was
kindled
against
and
anger
also
came
up
against
because
they
believed
not
in
and
trusted
not
in
his
though
he
had
commanded
the
clouds
from
and
opened
the
doors
of
and
had
rained
down
manna
upon
them
to
and
had
given
them
of
the
corn
of
man
did
eat
he
sent
them
meat
to
the
he
caused
an
east
wind
to
blow
in
the
and
by
his
power
he
brought
in
the
south
he
rained
flesh
also
upon
them
as
and
feathered
fowls
like
as
the
sand
of
the
and
he
let
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
round
about
their
so
they
did
and
were
well
for
he
gave
them
their
own
they
were
not
estranged
from
their
but
while
their
meat
yet
in
their
the
wrath
of
god
came
upon
and
slew
the
fattest
of
and
smote
down
the
chosen
of
for
all
this
they
sinned
and
believed
not
for
his
wondrous
therefore
their
days
did
he
consume
in
and
their
years
in
when
he
slew
then
they
sought
and
they
returned
and
enquired
early
after
and
they
remembered
that
god
their
and
the
high
god
their
nevertheless
they
did
flatter
him
with
their
and
they
lied
unto
him
with
their
for
their
heart
was
not
right
with
neither
were
they
stedfast
in
his
but
full
of
forgave
and
destroyed
many
a
time
turned
he
his
anger
and
did
not
stir
up
all
his
for
he
remembered
that
they
a
wind
that
passeth
and
cometh
not
how
oft
did
they
provoke
him
in
the
grieve
him
in
the
they
turned
back
and
tempted
and
limited
the
holy
one
of
they
remembered
not
his
the
day
when
he
delivered
them
from
the
how
he
had
wrought
his
signs
in
and
his
wonders
in
the
field
of
and
had
turned
their
rivers
into
and
their
that
they
could
not
he
sent
divers
sorts
of
flies
among
which
devoured
and
which
destroyed
he
gave
also
their
increase
unto
the
and
their
labour
unto
the
he
destroyed
their
vines
with
and
their
sycomore
trees
with
he
gave
up
their
cattle
also
to
the
and
their
flocks
to
hot
he
cast
upon
them
the
fierceness
of
his
and
and
by
sending
evil
angels
he
made
a
way
to
his
he
spared
not
their
soul
from
but
gave
their
life
over
to
the
and
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
the
chief
of
strength
in
the
tabernacles
of
but
made
his
own
people
to
go
forth
like
and
guided
them
in
the
wilderness
like
a
and
he
led
them
on
so
that
they
feared
but
the
sea
overwhelmed
their
and
he
brought
them
to
the
border
of
his
this
his
right
hand
had
he
cast
out
the
heathen
also
before
and
divided
them
an
inheritance
by
and
made
the
tribes
of
israel
to
dwell
in
their
yet
they
tempted
and
provoked
the
most
high
and
kept
not
his
but
turned
and
dealt
unfaithfully
like
their
they
were
turned
aside
like
a
deceitful
for
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
high
and
moved
him
to
jealousy
with
their
graven
when
god
heard
he
was
and
greatly
abhorred
so
that
he
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
the
tent
he
placed
among
and
delivered
his
strength
into
and
his
glory
into
the
he
gave
his
people
over
also
unto
the
and
was
wroth
with
his
the
fire
consumed
their
young
and
their
maidens
were
not
given
to
their
priests
fell
by
the
and
their
widows
made
no
then
the
lord
awaked
as
one
out
of
like
a
mighty
man
that
shouteth
by
reason
of
and
he
smote
his
enemies
in
the
hinder
he
put
them
to
a
perpetual
moreover
he
refused
the
tabernacle
of
and
chose
not
the
tribe
of
but
chose
the
tribe
of
the
mount
zion
which
he
and
he
built
his
sanctuary
like
high
like
the
earth
which
he
hath
established
for
he
chose
david
also
his
and
took
him
from
the
from
following
the
ewes
great
with
young

brought
him
to
feed

fed
them
according

skilfulness
of
his

rebuked

he
saved

that
hated

redeemed

from

the

covered

then
believed
they
his
they
sang

they
soon
forgat
his
they
waited
not
for

lusted
exceedingly
in

tempted
god
in

he
gave

sent
leanness
into

they
envied
moses
also
in
the
aaron
the
saint
of
the
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
up
and
covered
the
company
of
and
a
fire
was
kindled
in
their
the
flame
burned
up
the
they
made
a
calf
in
and
worshipped
the
molten
thus
they
changed
their
glory
into
the
similitude
of
an
ox
that
eateth
they
forgat
god
their
which
had
done
great
things
in
wondrous
works
in
the
land
of
terrible
things
by
the
red
therefore
he
said
that
he
would
destroy
had
not
moses
his
chosen
stood
before
him
in
the
to
turn
away
his
lest
he
should
destroy
they
despised
the
pleasant
they
believed
not
his
but
murmured
in
their
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
therefore
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against

overthrow
them
in
the
to
overthrow
their
seed
also
among
the
and
to
scatter
them
in
the
they
joined
themselves
also
unto
and
ate
the
sacrifices
of
the
thus
they
provoked
to
anger
with
their
and
the
plague
brake
in
upon
then
stood
up
and
executed
and
the
plague
was
and
that
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
unto
all
generations
for
they
angered
also
at
the
waters
of
so
that
it
went
ill
with
moses
for
their
because
they
provoked
his
so
that
he
spake
unadvisedly
with
his
they
did
not
destroy
the
concerning
whom
the
lord
commanded
but
were
mingled
among
the
and
learned
their
and
they
served
their
which
were
a
snare
unto
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
and
shed
innocent
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
of
and
the
land
was
polluted
with
thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
own
and
went
a
whoring
with
their
own
therefore
was
the
wrath
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
insomuch
that
he
abhorred
his
own
and
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
and
they
that
hated
them
ruled
over
their
enemies
also
oppressed
and
they
were
brought
into
subjection
under
their
many
times
did
he
deliver
but
they
provoked
with
their
and
were
brought
low
for
their
nevertheless
he
regarded
their
when
he
heard
their
and
he
remembered
for
them
his
and
repented
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
he
made
them
also
to
be
pitied
of
all
those
that
carried
them

to

wisdom
concerning
all
that
are
done
under
this
sore
travail
hath
god
given
to
the
sons
of

to
be

have
seen

that
are
done
under
the
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
which
crooked
cannot
be
made
and
that
which
is
wanting
cannot

communed
with

own
i
am
come
to

and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
that
have
been
before
me
in
my
heart
had
great
experience
of
wisdom
and
and
i
gave
my
heart
to
know
and
to
know
madness
and
i
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
for
in
much
wisdom
much
and

that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth

said
in

will

therefore
enjoy
this

i
said
of
and
of
what
doeth
i
sought
in
mine
heart
to
give
myself
unto
yet
acquainting
mine
heart
with
and
to
lay
hold
on
till
i
might
see
what
that
good
for
the
sons
of
which
they
should
do
under
the
heaven
all
the
days
of
their
i
made
me
great
i
builded
me
i
planted
me
i
made
me
gardens
and
and
i
planted
trees
in
them
of
all
i
made
me
pools
of
to
water
therewith
the
wood
that
bringeth
forth
i
got
servants
and
and
had
servants
born
in
my
also
i
had
great
possessions
of
great
and
small
cattle
above
all
that
were
in
jerusalem
before
i
gathered
me
also
silver
and
and
the
peculiar
treasure
of
kings
and
of
the
i
gat
me
men
singers
and
women
and
the
delights
of
the
sons
of
musical
and
that
of
all
so
i
was
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
me
in
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
and
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
i
kept
not
from
i
withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
then
i
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
and
on
the
labour
that
i
had
laboured
to
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
and
no
profit
under
the
and
i
turned
myself
to
behold
and
and
for
what
the
man
that
cometh
after
the
that
which
hath
been
already
then
i
saw
that
wisdom
excelleth
as
far
as
light
excelleth
the
wise
eyes
in
his
but
the
fool
walketh
in
and
i
myself
perceived
also
that
one
event
happeneth
to
them
then
said
i
in
my
as
it
happeneth
to
the
so
it
happeneth
even
to
and
why
was
i
then
more
then
i
said
in
my
that
this
also
for
no
remembrance
of
the
wise
more
than
of
the
fool
for
seeing
that
which
now
in
the
days
to
come
shall
all
be
and
how
dieth
the
wise
as
the
therefore
i
hated
because
the
work
that
is
wrought
under
the
sun
grievous
unto
for
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
i
hated
all
my
labour
which
i
had
taken
under
the
because
i
should
leave
it
unto
the
man
that
shall
be
after
and
who
knoweth
whether
he
shall
be
a
wise
or
a
yet
shall
he
have
rule
over
all
my
labour
wherein
i
have
and
wherein
i
have
shewed
myself
wise
under
the
this
also
therefore
i
went
about
to
cause
my
heart
to
despair
of
all
the
labour
which
i
took
under
the
for
there
is
a
man
whose
labour
in
and
in
and
in
yet
to
a
man
that
hath
not
laboured
therein
shall
he
leave
it
his
this
also
vanity
and
a
great
for
what
hath
man
of
all
his
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
wherein
he
hath
laboured
under
the
for
all
his
days
and
his
travail
his
heart
taketh
not
rest
in
the
this
is
also
nothing
better
for
a
that
he
should
eat
and
and
he
should
make
his
soul
enjoy
good
in
his
this
also
i
that
it
from
the
hand
of
for
who
can
or
who
else
can
hasten
more
than
for
giveth
to
a
man
that
good
in
his
sight
and
and
but
to
the
sinner
he
giveth
to
gather
and
to
heap
that
he
may
give
to
that
good
before
this
also
vanity
and
vexation
of

so
that
no

find
out
the
work
that
god
maketh
from
the
beginning
to
the
i
know
that
no
good
in

for
to
and
to
do
good
in
his
and
also
that
every
man
should
eat

know
whatsoever
god
it
shall
be
for
nothing

be
put
to

any

taken
from

god
doeth
that
should
fear
before
that
which
hath
been
is
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
and
god
requireth
that
which
is
and
moreover
i
saw
under
the
sun
the
place
of
wickedness
and
the
place
of
iniquity
i
said
in
mine
god
shall
judge
the
righteous
and
the
for
a
time
there
for
every
purpose
and
for
every
i
said
in
mine
heart
concerning
the
estate
of
the
sons
of
that
god
might
manifest
and
that
they
might
see
that
they
themselves
are
for
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
of
men
befalleth
even
one
thing
befalleth
as
the
one
so
dieth
the
they
have
all
one
so
that
a
man
hath
no
preeminence
above
a
for
all
all
go
unto
one
all
are
of
the
and
all
turn
to
dust
who
knoweth
the
spirit
of
man
that
goeth
and
the
spirit
of
the
beast
that
goeth
downward
to
the
wherefore
i
perceive
that
nothing
than
that
a
man
should
rejoice
in
his
own
for
that
his
for
who
shall
bring
him
to
see
what
shall
be
after

the
tears
of

they
had
no

on
the
side

i
praised
the

already
dead
more
than

are

better

both
which
hath
not

who
hath
not

the
evil
work
that
is
done
under

considered
all

every
right
that
for

envied
of

his

eateth
his

an

i

god
answereth
in

there
is
an

thine

that
thou
thyself
likewise
hast
cursed
all
this
have
i
proved
by
i
i
will
be
but
it
far
from
that
which
is
far
and
exceeding
who
can
find
it
i
applied
mine
heart
to
and
to
and
to
seek
out
and
the
reason
and
to
know
the
wickedness
of
even
of
foolishness
and
i
find
more
bitter
than
death
the
whose
heart
snares
and
her
hands
whoso
pleaseth
god
shall
escape
from
but
the
sinner
shall
be
taken
by
this
have
i
saith
the
one
by
to
find
out
the
which
yet
my
soul
but
i
find
one
man
among
a
thousand
have
i
but
a
woman
among
all
those
have
i
not
this
only
have
i
that
god
hath
made
man
but
they
have
sought
out
many
chapter
who
as
the
wise
and
who
knoweth
the
interpretation
of
a
a
wisdom
maketh
his
face
to
and
the
boldness
of
his
face
shall
be
i
to
keep
the
and
in
regard
of
the
oath
of
be
not
hasty
to
go
out
of
his
stand
not
in
an
evil
for
he
doeth
whatsoever
pleaseth
where
the
word
of
a
king
there
and
who
may
say
unto
what
doest
whoso
keepeth
the
commandment
shall
feel
no
evil
and
a
wise
heart
discerneth
both
time
and
because
to
every
purpose
there
is
time
and
therefore
the
misery
of
man
great
upon
for
he
knoweth
not
that
which
shall
for
who
can
tell
him
when
it
shall
no
man
that
hath
power
over
the
spirit
to
retain
the
neither
power
in
the
day
of
and
no
discharge
in
neither
shall
wickedness
deliver
those
that
are
given
to
all
this
have
i
and
applied
my
heart
unto
every
work
that
is
done
under
the
a
time
wherein
one
man
ruleth
over
another
to
his
own
and
so
i
saw
the
wicked
who
had
come
and
gone
from
the
place
of
the
and
they
were
forgotten
in
the
city
where
they
had
so
this
also
because
sentence
against
an
evil
work
is
not
executed
therefore
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
fully
set
in
them
to
do
though
a
sinner
do
evil
an
hundred
and
his
be
yet
surely
i
know
that
it
shall
be
well
with
them
that
fear
which
fear
before
but
it
shall
not
be
well
with
the
neither
shall
he
prolong
as
a
because
he
feareth
not
before
there
is
a
vanity
which
is
done
upon
the
that
there
be
just
unto
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
there
be
wicked
to
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
i
said
that
this
also
then
i
commended
because
a
man
hath
no
better
thing
under
the
than
to
and
to
and
to
be
for
that
shall
abide
with
him
of
his
labour
the
days
of
his
which
god
giveth
him
under
the
when
i
applied
mine
heart
to
know
and
to
see
the
business
that
is
done
upon
the
also
is
neither
day
nor
night
seeth
sleep
with
his
then
i
beheld
all
the
work
of
that
a
man
cannot
find
out
the
work
that
is
done
under
the
because
though
a
man
labour
to
seek
yet
he
shall
not
find
yea
though
a
wise
think
to
know
yet
shall
he
not
be
able
to
find
chapter
for
all
this
i
considered
in
my
heart
even
to
declare
all
that
the
and
the
and
their
in
the
hand
of
no
man
knoweth
either
love
or
hatred
all
before
all
alike
to
one
event
to
the
and
to
the
to
the
good
and
to
the

to
the
to
him
that
and
to
him
that
sacrificeth
as
the
so
the
he
that
as
that
feareth
an
this
an
evil
among
all
that
are
done
under
the
that
one
event
unto
also
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
full
of
and
madness
in
their
heart
while
they
and
after
that
to
the
for
to
him
that
is
joined
to
all
the
living
there
is

a
living
dog

better

the

was
found
in

a
poor

by
his

no

the

his

heard
in

make
this
house
like
and
will
make
this
city
a
curse
to
all
the
nations
of
the
so
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
jeremiah
speaking
these
words
in
the
house
of
the
now
it
came
to
when
jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
that
the
lord
had
commanded
to
speak
unto
all
the
that
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
took
thou
shalt
surely
why
hast
thou
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
this
house
shall
be
like
and
this
city
shall
be
desolate
without
an
and
all
the
people
were
gathered
against
jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
when
the
princes
of
judah
heard
these
then
they
came
up
from
the
house
unto
the
house
of
the
and
sat
down
in
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
then
spake
the
priests
and
the
prophets
unto
the
princes
and
to
all
the
this
man
worthy
to
for
he
hath
prophesied
against
this
as
ye
have
heard
with
your
then
spake
jeremiah
unto
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
the
lord
sent
me
to
prophesy
against
this
house
and
against
this
city
all
the
words
that
ye
have
therefore
now
amend
your
ways
and
your
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
and
the
lord
will
repent
him
of
the
evil
that
he
hath
pronounced
against
as
for
i
in
your
do
with
me
as
seemeth
good
and
meet
unto
but
know
ye
for
that
if
ye
put
me
to
ye
shall
surely
bring
innocent
blood
upon
and
upon
this
and
upon
the
inhabitants
for
of
a
truth
the
lord
hath
sent
me
unto
you
to
speak
all
these
words
in
your
then
said
the
princes
and
all
the
people
unto
the
priests
and
to
the
this
man
not
worthy
to
for
he
hath
spoken
to
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
our
then
rose
up
certain
of
the
elders
of
the
and
spake
to
all
the
assembly
of
the
micah
the
morasthite
prophesied
in
the
days
of
hezekiah
king
of

spake
to
all
the

he
not
fear
the
and
besought
the
and
the
lord
repented
him
of
the
evil
which
he
had
pronounced
against
thus
might
we
procure
great
evil
against
our
and
there
was
also
a
man
that
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
urijah
the
son
of
shemaiah
of

prophesied
against
this

all
his
mighty

jehoiakim
the
king
sent
men
into

men
with
him
into

they
fetched
forth
urijah
out
of

brought
him
unto
jehoiakim
the
who
slew
him
with
the
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
of
the
common
nevertheless
the
hand
of
ahikam
the
son
of

was
with

unto

have
only
done
evil
before
me
from
their
for
the

have
only
provoked
me
to
anger
with
the
work
of
their
saith
the
for
this
city
hath
been
to
me
a
provocation
of
mine
anger
and
of
my

from
the
day
that
they
built
it

taught
rising
up
early
and
teaching

they
have
not
hearkened
to
receive
but
they
set
their
abominations
in
the

to
considerest
thou

the
two
families
which
the
lord
hath
he
hath

for
i
will
cause
their
captivity
to
and
have
mercy
on
chapter
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
when
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
and
all
his
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
of
his
and
all
the
fought
against
and
against
all
the
cities
thus
saith
the
the
god
of
go

speak
to
zedekiah
king
of
and
tell
thus
saith
the
i
will
give
this
city
into

of
the
king
of
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
his
but

surely
be
and
delivered
into
his
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
and
he
shall
speak
with
thee
mouth
to
and
thou
shalt
go
to
yet
hear
the
word
of
the
o
zedekiah
king
of
thus
saith
the
lord
of
thou

not
die
by
the
thou

of
thy
the
former

so
shall
they
burn
for
and
they
will
lament
ah
for
i
have
pronounced
the
saith
the
then
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
all
these
words
unto
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
when
the
king
of
army
fought
against
and
against
all
the
cities
of
judah
that
were
against
and
against
for
these
defenced
cities
remained
of
the
cities
of
the
word
that
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
after
that
the
king
zedekiah
had
made
a
covenant
with
all
the
people
which
at
to
proclaim
liberty
unto
that
every

his
and
every
man
his
an

now
when
all
the

all
the
which

that
every

every
one
his
go
that

and
caused
the
servants
and
the
whom
they
had
let
go
to
and
brought
them
into
subjection
for
servants
and
for
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
thus
saith
the
the
god
of
i
made
a
covenant
with
your
fathers
in

brother
an
which

been
sold
unto
and
when
he
hath
served
thee
six
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from

your
fathers
hearkened
not
unto
neither
inclined
their
and
ye
were
now
and
had
done
right
in
my
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
man
to
his
and
ye
had
made
a
covenant
before
me
in
the
house

whom
ye
had
set
at
liberty
at
their
to

to
his
i
proclaim

the
evil
that

place
whither

and
it
came
to
when
jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of

unto
all
the
people
all
the
words
of
the

proud
saying
unto
thou
speakest
the
lord
our
god

setteth
thee
on

to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of

that
they
might
put
us

johanan
the
son
of
and
all
the
captains
of
the
and
all
the
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
to
dwell
in

land
of
but
johanan
the
son
of
and
all
the
captains
of

son
of
so
they
came
into
the
land
of
for
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of

thus
came
they
to
then
came
the
word
of

away
and
he

array
himself
with

upon
all
the

sent
unto
you
all
my

not
this
abominable
thing
that
i
but
they
hearkened
nor
inclined
their
ear
to
turn
from
their
to
burn
no
incense
unto
other
wherefore
my
fury
and
mine
anger
was
poured
and
was
kindled
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
and

land
of
whither

and
a
reproach
among
all
the

forgotten
the
wickedness
of
your

the
wickedness
of

the
wickedness
of
their

the
wickedness
of

i
wrought
for
my
that

polluted
before
the
among
whom
they
in
whose
sight
i
made
myself
known
unto
in
bringing
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of

i
caused
them
to
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of

brought
them
into

and
i
gave
them
my
and
shewed
them
my
which
a
man
he
shall
even
live
in
moreover
also
i
gave
them
my
to
be
a
sign
between
me
and
that
they
might
know
that
i
the
lord
that
sanctify
but
the
house
of
israel
rebelled
against
me
in
the
they
walked
not
in
my
and
they
despised
my
which
a
man
he
shall
even
live
in
and
my
sabbaths
they
greatly
then
i
i
would
pour
out
my

i
wrought
for
my
that

i
brought

yet
also
i
lifted
up
my

unto
them
in
the
that

i
had
given

the
glory
of

despised
my

heart
went
after
their

mine
eye
spared
them
from
destroying
neither
did
i
make
an
end
of
them
in
the
but
i
said
unto
their
children
in
the
walk

not
in
the
statutes
of
your
neither
observe
their
nor
defile
yourselves
with
their

your
walk
in

lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
also
in
the
that
i
would
scatter
them
among

disperse
them
through

because
they
had
not
executed
my
but
had
despised
my
and

polluted
my
and
their
eyes
were
after
their
wherefore
i
gave
them
also
statutes
not

judgments
whereby

i
polluted
them
in
their

in
that

all
the
thick

they
offered
there
their

there
they
presented
the
provocation
of
their
there
also
they
made
their
sweet
and
poured
out
there
their
drink

and
the
secret
which
the
king
hath
demanded
cannot

shew
unto
the
but
there
is
a
god
in

that
revealeth
and
maketh
known
to
the

for

that
i
have
more
than

for

that

and
that
thou
mightest
know
the
thoughts
of
thy
o
and
behold
a
great
this
great
whose
brightness
stood
before

the
form
thereof
this

of

his
thighs
of
his
legs
of
his

part
of

sawest
till
that
a
stone
was
cut
out
without
which
smote
the
image
upon
his
feet
of
iron
and
and
brake
them
to

was
the
the

became
like
the
chaff
of

the
wind
carried
them
that
no

was
found
for

the
stone
that
smote
the
image
became
a
great
and
filled
the
whole
this
the
and
we
will
tell
the
interpretation
thereof
before
the
o
a
king

the
god
of

hath
given
thee
a

and
and
wheresoever
the

made
thee
ruler
over
them
thou
this
head
of

after
thee
shall
arise
another
kingdom
inferior

another
third
kingdom
of

shall
bear
rule
over
all
the

the
fourth
kingdom
shall
be
strong
as
forasmuch
as
iron
breaketh

pieces
and
subdueth
all

as
iron
that
breaketh
all

it
break
in
pieces
and
and
whereas
thou
sawest
the
feet

there
shall
be
in

they

set
up
a
which

never

the

the
great
god
hath
made
known
to
the

what
shall
come
to

and
the
dream
and
the

thereof
then
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
fell
upon
his
and
worshipped
and
commanded
that
they
should
offer
an
oblation
and
sweet
odours
unto
the

answered
unto

of
a
truth
that
your
god
a
god
of

a
lord
of

a
revealer
of

wherefore
at
that
time
certain

they
spake
and
said
to
the
king
o

that
every

and
he
should
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
there
are
certain
jews
whom
thou
hast
set
over

province
of
and
these
o
have
not
regarded
they

not
thy
nor

the
golden
image

thou
hast
set
then
nebuchadnezzar
in
rage
and
fury
commanded
to
bring
and
then
they
brought
these
men
before
the
nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
unto

you
out
of

answered
and
said
to
the
o
we
not
careful
to
answer
thee
in
this
if
it
be
our
god
whom
we
serve
is
able
to
deliver
us
from
the
burning
fiery
and
he
will
deliver
out
of
thine
o
but
if
be
it
known
unto
o
that
we
will
not
serve
thy
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
then
was
nebuchadnezzar
full
of
and
the
form
of
his
visage
was
changed
against
and
he
and
commanded
that
they
should
heat
the
furnace
one
seven
times
more
than
it
was
wont
to
be
and
he
commanded
the
most
mighty
men
that
in
his
army
to
bind
and
to
cast
into
the
burning
fiery
then
these
men
were
bound
in
their
their
and
their
and
their
and
were
cast
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
therefore
because
the
commandment
was
and
the
furnace
exceeding
the
flame
of
the
fire
slew
those
men
that
took
up
and
and
these
three
and
fell
down
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
then
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
was
and
rose
up
in
and
said
unto
his
did
not
we
cast
three
men
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
they
answered
and
said
unto
the
o
he
answered
and
i
see
four
men
walking
in
the
midst
of
the
and
they
have
no
and
the
form
of
the
fourth
is
like
the
son
of
then
nebuchadnezzar
came
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
burning
fiery
and
and
ye
servants
of
the
most
high
come
and
come
then
and
came
forth
of
the
midst
of
the
and
the
and
and
the
being
gathered
saw
these
upon
whose
bodies
the
fire
had
no
nor
was
an
hair
of
their
head
neither
were
their
coats
nor
the
smell
of
fire
had
passed
on
nebuchadnezzar
and
blessed
the
god
of
and
who
hath
sent
his
and
delivered
his
servants
that
trusted
in
and
have
changed
the
and
yielded
their
that
they
might
not
serve
nor
worship
any
except
their

therefore
i
make
a
that
every

which
speak
any
thing
amiss
against
the
god
of

shall
be
cut
in
and
their
houses

there
is
no
other

to
him
the
o
thou
the
most
high
god

would
he
and
whom
he
would
he
kept
and
whom
he
would
he
set
and
whom
he
would
he
put
but
when
his
heart
was
lifted
and
his
mind
hardened
in
he
was
deposed
from
his
kingly
and
they
took
his
glory
from
and
he
was
driven
from
the
sons
of
and
his
heart
was
made
like
the
and
his
dwelling
with
the
wild
they
fed
him
with
grass
like
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
till
he
knew
that
the
most
high
god
ruled
in

he
appointeth
over

thou
his

they
have
brought
the
vessels
of
his
house
before
and
and
thy
thy
and
thy
have
drunk
wine
in
and
thou
hast
praised
the
gods
of

which
see
nor

and
the
god
in
whose
hand
thy
breath
and
whose
all
thy

thou
not
then
was
the
part
of
the
hand
sent
from

this
writing
was
and
this
the
writing
that
was
this
the
interpretation
of
the
god
hath
numbered
thy
and
finished
thou
art
weighed
in
the
and
art
found
thy
kingdom
is
and
given

and
then
commanded
and
they
clothed
daniel
with
and
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
and
made
a
proclamation
concerning
that
he
should
be
the
third

that
night
was
belshazzar
the
king
of
the
chaldeans
and
darius
the

it
pleased
darius
to
set
over
the
kingdom
an
hundred
and
twenty
which
should
be
over
the
whole
and
over
these
three
of
whom
daniel
that
the
princes
might
give
accounts
unto
and
the
king
should
have
no
then
this
daniel
was
preferred
above
the
presidents
and
because
an
excellent
spirit
in
and
the
king
thought
to
set
him
over
the
whole
then
the
presidents
and
princes
sought
to
find
occasion
against
daniel
concerning
the
but
they
could
find
none
occasion
nor
forasmuch
as
he
neither
was
there
any
error
or
fault
found
in
then
said
these
we
shall
not
find
any
occasion
against
this
except
we
find
against
him
concerning
the
law
of
his
then
these
presidents
and
princes
assembled
together
to
the
and
said
thus
unto
king
live
for
all
the
presidents
of
the
the

the
the
and
the
have
consulted
together
to
establish
a
royal

or
man
for
thirty
save
of

establish
the
and
sign
the
that
it
be
not
according
to
the
law
of
the
medes
and
which
altereth
wherefore
king
darius
signed
the
writing
and
the
now
when
daniel
knew
that
the
writing
was
he
went
into
his
and
his
windows
being
open
in
his
chamber
toward
he
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a
and
and
gave
thanks
before
his
as
he
did
then
these
men
and
found
daniel
praying
and
making
supplication
before
his
then
they
came
and
spake
before
the
king
concerning
the
hast
thou
not
signed
a
that
every
man
that

into
the
den
of
the
king
answered
and
the
thing
according
to
the
law
of
the
medes
and
which
altereth
then
answered
they
and
said
before
the
that
which
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
regardeth
not
o
nor
the
decree
that
thou
hast
but
maketh
his
petition
three
times
a
then
the
when
he
heard
was
sore
displeased
with
and
set
heart
on
daniel
to
deliver
and
he
laboured
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
to
deliver
then
these
men
assembled
unto
the
and
said
unto
the
o
that
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
that
no
decree
nor
statute
which
the
king
establisheth
may
be
then
the
king
and
they
brought
and
cast
into
the
den
of
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
thy
god
whom
thou
servest
he
will
deliver
and
a
stone
was
and
laid
upon
the
mouth
of
the
and
the
king
sealed
it
with
his
own
and
with
the
signet
of
his
that
the
purpose
might
not
be
changed
concerning
then
the
king
went
to
his
and
passed
the
night
neither
were
instruments
of
musick
brought
before
and
his
sleep
went
from
then
the
king
arose
very
early
in
the
and
went
in
haste
unto
the
den
of
and
when
he
came
to
the
he
cried
with
a
lamentable
voice
unto
the
king
spake
and
said
to
o
servant
of
the
living
is
thy
whom
thou
servest
able
to
deliver
thee
from
the
then
said
daniel
unto
the
o
live
for
my
god
hath
sent
his
and
hath
shut
the
that
they
have
not
hurt
forasmuch
as
before
him
innocency
was
found
in
and
also
before
o
have
i
done
no
then
was
the
king
exceeding
glad
for
and
commanded
that
they
should
take
daniel
up
out
of
the
so
daniel
was
taken
up
out
of
the
and
no
manner
of
hurt
was
found
upon
because
he
believed
in
his
and
the
king
and
they
brought
those
men
which
had
accused
and
they
cast
into
the
den
of
their
and
their
and
the
lions
had
the
mastery
of
and
brake
all
their
bones
in
pieces
or
ever
they
came
at
the
bottom
of
the
then
king
darius
wrote
unto
all
and
that
dwell
in
all
the
peace
be
multiplied
unto
i
make
a
that
in
every
dominion
of
my
kingdom
men
tremble
and
fear
before
the
god
of
for
he
the
living
and
stedfast
for
and
his
kingdom
which
shall
not
be
and
his
dominion
be
unto
the
he
delivereth
and
and
he
worketh
signs
and
wonders
in
heaven
and
in
who
hath
delivered
daniel
from
the
power
of
the
so
this
daniel
prospered
in
the
reign
of
and
in
the
reign
of
cyrus
the
chapter
in
the
first
year
of
belshazzar
king
of
babylon
daniel
had
a
dream
and
visions
of
his
head
upon
his
then
he
wrote
the
told
the
sum
of
the
daniel
spake
and
i
saw
in
my
vision
by
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven
strove
upon
the
great
and
four
great
beasts
came
up
from
the
diverse
one
from
the
first
like
a
and
had
i
beheld
till
the
wings
thereof
were
and
it
was
lifted
up
from
the
and
made
stand
upon
the
feet
as
a
and
a
heart
was
given
to
and
behold
another
a
like
to
a
and
it
raised
up
itself
on
one
and
three
ribs
in
the
mouth
of
it
between
the
teeth
of
and
they
said
thus
unto
devour
much
after
this
i
and
lo
like
a
which
had
upon
the
back
of
it
four
wings
of
a
the
beast
had
also
four
and
dominion
was
given
to
after
this
i
saw
in
the
night
and
behold
a
fourth
dreadful
and
and
strong
and
it
had
great
iron
it
devoured
and
brake
in
and
stamped
the
residue
with
the
feet
of
and
it
diverse
from
all
the
beasts
that
before
and
it
had
ten
i
considered
the
there
came
up
among
them
another
little
before
whom
there
were
three
of
the
first
horns
plucked
up
by
the
in
this
horn
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
and
a
mouth
speaking
great
i
beheld
till
the
thrones
were
cast
and
the
ancient
of
days
did
whose
garment
white
as
and
the
hair
of
his
head
like
the
pure
his
throne
the
fiery
his
wheels
burning
a
fiery
stream
issued
and
came
forth
from
before
thousand
thousands
ministered
unto
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
the
judgment
was
and
the
books
were
i
beheld
then
because
of
the
voice
of
the
great
words
which
the
horn
i
beheld
till
the
beast
was
and
his
body
and
given
to
the
burning
as
concerning
the
rest
of
the
they
had
their
dominion
taken
yet
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
a
season
and
i
saw
in
the
night
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
and
they
brought
him
near
before
and
there
was
given
him
and
and
a
that
all
and
should
serve
his
dominion
an
everlasting
which
shall
not
pass
and
his
kingdom
which
shall
not
be
i
daniel
was
grieved
in
my
spirit
in
the
midst
of
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
i
came
near
unto
one
of
them
that
stood
and
asked
him
the
truth
of
all
so
he
told
and
made
me
know
the
interpretation
of
the
these
great
which
are
four
shall
arise
out
of
the
but
the
saints
of
the
most
high
shall
take
the
and
possess
the
kingdom
for
even
for
ever
and
then
i
would
know
the
truth
of
the
fourth
which
was
diverse
from
all
the
exceeding
whose
teeth
and
his
nails
brake
in
and
stamped
the
residue
with
his
and
of
the
ten
horns
that
in
his
and
the
other
which
came
and
before
whom
three
even
that
horn
that
had
and
a
mouth
that
spake
very
great
whose
look
more
stout
than
his
i
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
and
prevailed
against
until
the
ancient
of
days
and
judgment
was
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
and
the
time
came
that
the
saints
possessed
the
thus
he
the
fourth
beast
shall
be
the
fourth
kingdom
upon
which
shall
be
diverse
from
all
and
shall
devour
the
whole
and
shall
tread
it
and
break
it
in
and
the
ten
horns
out
of
this
kingdom
ten
kings
shall
and
another
shall
rise
after
and
he
shall
be
diverse
from
the
and
he
shall
subdue
three
and
he
shall
speak
words
against
the
most
and
shall
wear
out
the
saints
of
the
most
and
think
to
change
times
and
and
they
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
until
a
time
and
times
and
the
dividing
of
but
the
judgment
shall
and
they
shall
take
away
his
to
consume
and
to
destroy
unto
the
and
the
kingdom
and
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
whose
kingdom
an
everlasting
and
all
dominions
shall
serve
and
obey
hitherto
the
end
of
the
as
for
me
my
cogitations
much
troubled
and
my
countenance
changed
in
but
i
kept
the
matter
in
my
chapter
in
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
king
belshazzar
a
vision
appeared
unto
me
after
that
which
appeared
unto
me
at
the
and
i
saw
in
a
and
it
came
to
when
i
that
i
at
shushan
the
which
in
the
province
of
and
i
saw
in
a
and
i
was
by
the
river
of
then
i
lifted
up
mine
and
there
stood
before
the
river
a
ram
which
had
and
the
horns
but
one
higher
than
the
and
the
higher
came
up
i
saw
the
ram
pushing
and
and
so
that
no
beasts
might
stand
before
neither
there
that
could
deliver
out
of
his
but
he
did
according
to
his
and
became
and
as
i
was
an
he
goat
came
from
the
west
on
the
face
of
the
whole
and
touched
not
the
and
the
goat
a
notable
horn
between
his
and
he
came
to
the
ram
that
had
which
i
had
seen
standing
before
the
and
ran
unto
him
in
the
fury
of
his
and
i
saw
him
come
close
unto
the
and
he
was
moved
with
choler
against
and
smote
the
and
brake
his
two
and
there
was
no
power
in
the
ram
to
stand
before
but
he
cast
him
down
to
the
and
stamped
upon
and
there
was
none
that
could
deliver
the
ram
out
of
his
therefore
the
he
goat
waxed
very
and
when
he
was
the
great
horn
was
and
for
it
came
up
four
notable
ones
toward
the
four
winds
of
and
out
of
one
of
them
came
forth
a
little
which
waxed
exceeding
toward
the
and
toward
the
and
toward
the
pleasant
and
it
waxed
to
the
host
of
and
it
cast
down
of
the
host
and
of
the
stars
to
the
and
stamped
upon
he
magnified
even
to
the
prince
of
the
and
by
him
the
daily
was
taken
and
the
place
of
his
sanctuary
was
cast
and
an
host
was
given
against
the
daily
by
reason
of
and
it
cast
down
the
truth
to
the
and
it
and
then
i
heard
one
saint
and
another
saint
said
unto
that
certain
which
how
long
the
vision
the
daily
and
the
transgression
of
to
give
both
the
sanctuary
and
the
host
to
be
trodden
under
and
he
said
unto
unto
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
then
shall
the
sanctuary
be
and
it
came
to
when
i
had
seen
the
and
sought
for
the
there
stood
before
me
as
the
appearance
of
a
and
i
heard
a
voice
between
banks
which
and
make
this
to
understand
the
so
he
came
near
where
i
and
when
he
i
was
and
fell
upon
my
but
he
said
unto
o
son
of
for
at
the
time
of
the
end
the
now
as
he
was
speaking
with
i
was
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
toward
the
but
he
touched
and
set
me
and
he
i
will
make
thee
know
what
shall
be
in
the
last
end
of
the
for
at
the
time
appointed
the
end
the
ram
which
thou
sawest
having
horns
the
kings
of
media
and
and
the
rough
goat
the
king
of
and
the
great
horn
that
between
his
eyes
the
first
now
that
being
whereas
four
stood
up
for
four
kingdoms
shall
stand
up
out

first
as
i
was
by
the
side
of

then
i
lifted
up
mine
and

a
certain
man
clothed
in
whose
loins
girded
with
fine
gold
of
his
body
also
like
the
and
his
face
as
the
appearance
of

his
eyes
as
lamps
of

his
arms
and
his
feet
like
in
colour
to
polished
and
the
voice
of
his
words
like
the
voice
of
a
and
i
daniel
alone
saw
the
for
the
men
that
were
with
me
saw
not
the
but
a
great
quaking
fell
upon
so
that
they
fled
to
hide
therefore
i
was
left
and
saw
this
great
and
there
remained
no
strength
in
for
my
comeliness
was
turned
in
me
into
and
i
retained
no
yet
heard
i
the
voice
of
his
and
when
i
heard
the
voice
of
his
then
was
i
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
and
my
face
toward
the
an
hand
touched
which
set
me
upon
my
knees
and
the
palms
of
my
and
he
said
unto
o
a
man

the
words
that

speak
unto
and

from
the
first
day
that
thou
didst
set
thine
heart
to
and
to
chasten
thyself
before
thy
thy
words
were

i
am
come
for
thy
but
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
of
persia
withstood
me
one
and
twenty
one
of
the
chief
came
to
help
and
i
remained
there
with
the
kings
of

i
am
come
to
make
thee
understand
what
shall
befall
thy
people
in
the
latter
for
yet
the
vision
for
and
when
he
had
spoken
such
words
unto
i
set
my
face
toward
the
and
i
became
like
the
similitude
of
the
sons
of
men

my
then
i
opened
my
and
and
said
unto
him
that
stood
before
o
my
by
the
vision
my
sorrows
are
turned
upon
and
i
have
retained
no
for
how
can
the
servant
of
this
my
lord
talk
with
this
my
for
as
for
straightway
there
remained
no
strength
in
neither
is
there
breath
left
in
then
there

again
and
touched
me
like
the
appearance
of
a

when
he
had
spoken
unto

shall
give
him
the

after
this
shall

turn
his

behalf
shall
cause
the
reproach
offered
by
him
to

he
shall
cause
to

shall
stand
up
in
his
estate
a
raiser

estate
shall
stand
up
a
vile

after
the
league
with
him
he
shall
work
for
he
shall
come

stir
up
his

be
stirred
up
to
battle
with
a
very
great

himself
above

marvellous
things
against

prosper
till
the
indignation
be

neither

these
shall
escape
out
of

of
the
children
of

shall
stretch
forth
his
hand
also
upon

turn
away
from

god
saw

god
repented
of
the
that
he
had
said
that
he
would
do
unto

he
did
chapter
but
it
displeased
jonah
and
he
was
very
and
he
prayed
unto

and
i
pray
o
not

my
when
i
was
yet
in

i
fled
before

i
knew
that
thou
a
gracious
and
slow
to

of
great
and
repentest
thee
of
the
therefore
o
i
beseech
my
life
from

better
for
me
to
die
than
to

said
the
doest
thou
well
to
be
so
jonah
went
out
of

sat
on
the
east
side
of
the

there
made
him
a
and
sat
under
it
in
the
till
he
might
see
what
would
become
of
the

the
lord
god
prepared
a
and
made
to
come
up
over
that
it
might
be
a
shadow
over
his
to
deliver
him
from

so
jonah
was
exceeding
glad
of
the
but
god
prepared
a
worm
when
the
morning
rose
the
next
and
it
smote
the
gourd
that
it
and
it
came
to
when
the

god
prepared
a
vehement
east

beat
upon

wished
in
himself
to

better
for
me
to
die
than

god
said
to
doest
thou
well
to
be
angry
for
the
and
he
i
do
well
to
be
unto
then
said
the
thou
hast
had
pity
on

the
which
thou
hast
not
neither
madest

he
came
and
dwelt
in

he
said
unto
o
generation
of

i
say
unto

able
of

stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
and
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of

therefore
every
tree
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
and
cast
into
the
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto

he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
whose

i
am
not
worthy
to
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the

in
his

he
will
throughly
purge
his

gather
his
wheat
into

that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
to
be
seen
of
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
father
which
is
in
therefore
when
thou
doest
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
that
they
may
have
glory
of

i

unto
they
have
their
but
when
thou
doest
let
not
thy
left

know
what
thy
right
hand
that
thine
alms
may
be
in

thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
himself
shall
reward
thee
and
when
thou
thou
shalt
not
be
as
the
hypocrites
for
they
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
corners
of
the
that
they
may
be
seen
of
verily
i
say
unto
they
have
their
but
when
thou
enter
into
thy
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
pray
to
thy
father
which
is
in
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
but
when
ye
use
not
vain
as
the
heathen
for
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
for
your
father
knoweth
what
things
ye
have
need
before
ye
ask
after
this
manner
therefore
pray
our
father
which
art
in
hallowed
be
thy
thy
kingdom
thy
will
be
done
in
as
in
give
us
this
day
our
daily
and
forgive
us
our
as
we
forgive
our

lead
us
not
into
but
deliver
us
from
for
thine
is
the
and
the
and
the
for
for
if
ye
forgive
men
their
your
heavenly
father
will
also
forgive
but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
neither
will
your
father
forgive
your
moreover
when
ye
be
as
the
of
a
sad
for
they
disfigure
their
that
they
may
appear
unto
men
to
verily
i
say
unto
they
have
their
but
when
thou
anoint
thine
and
wash
thy
that
thou
appear
not
unto
men
to
but
unto
thy
father
which
is
in
and
thy
which
seeth
in
shall
reward
thee
lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
where
moth
and
rust
doth
and
where
thieves
break
through
and
but
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
and
where
thieves
do
not
break
through
nor
for
where
your
treasure
there
will
your
heart
be
the
light
of
the
body
is
the
if
therefore
thine
eye
be
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
but
if
thine
eye
be
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
if
therefore
the
light
that
is
in
thee
be
how
great
that
no
man
can
serve
two
for
either
he
will
hate
the
and
love
the
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
and
despise
the
ye
cannot
serve
god
and
therefore
i
say
unto
take
no
thought
for
your
what
ye
shall
or
what
ye
shall
nor
yet
for
your
what
ye
shall
put
is
not
the
life
more
than
and
the
body
than
behold
the
fowls
of
the
for
they
sow
neither
do
they
nor
gather
into
yet
your
heavenly
father
feedeth
are
ye
not
much
better
than
which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
unto
his
and
why
take
ye
thought
for
consider
the
lilies
of
the
how
they
they
toil
neither
do
they
and
yet
i
say
unto
that
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
which
to
day
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
not
much
more
o
ye
of
little
therefore
take
no
what
shall
we
what
shall
we
wherewithal
shall
we
be
after
all
these
things
do
the
gentiles
for
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
but
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
and
his
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
for
the
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things
of
sufficient
unto
the
day
the
evil
chapter
judge
that
ye
be
not
for
with
what
judgment
ye
ye
shall
be
and
with
what
measure
ye
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
let
me
pull
out
the
mote
out
of
thine
a
beam
in
thine
own
thou
first
cast
out
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
out
the
mote
out
of
thy
give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
and
turn
again
and
rend
and
it
shall
be
given
and
ye
shall
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
for
every
one
that
asketh
and
he
that
seeketh
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
or
what
man
is
there
of
whom
if
his
son
ask
will
he
give
him
a
or
if
he
ask
a
will
he
give
him
a
if
ye
being
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
do
ye
even
so
to
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
for
wide
the
and
broad
the
that
leadeth
to
and
many
there
be
which
go
in
because
strait
the
and
narrow
the
which
leadeth
unto
and
few
there
be
that
find
beware
of
false
which
come
to
you
in
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
ye
shall
know
them
by
their
do
men
gather
grapes
of
or
figs
of
even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
a
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
neither
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
and
cast
into
the
wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
not
every
one
that
saith
unto
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
many
will
say
to
me
in
that
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
and
then
will
i
profess
unto
i
never
knew
depart
from
ye
that
work
therefore
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
and
doeth
i
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
which
built
his
house
upon
a
and
the
rain
and
the
floods
and
the
winds
and
beat
upon
that
and
it
fell
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
and
every
one
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
and
doeth
them
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
which
built
his
house
upon
the
and
the
rain
and
the
floods
and
the
winds
and
beat
upon
that
and
it
and
great
was
the
fall
of
and
it
came
to
when
jesus
had
ended
these
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
for
he
taught
them
as
having
and
not
as
the
chapter
when
he
was
come
down
from
the
great
multitudes
followed
there
came
a
leper
and
worshipped
if
thou
thou
canst
make
me
and
jesus
put
forth
and
touched
i
be
thou
and
immediately
his
leprosy
was
and
jesus
saith
unto
see
thou
tell
no
but
go
thy
shew
thyself
to
the
and
offer
the
gift
that
moses
for
a
testimony
unto
and
when
jesus
was
entered
into
there
came
unto
him
a
beseeching
and
my
servant
lieth
at
home
sick
of
the
grievously
and
jesus
saith
unto
i
will
come
and
heal
the
centurion
answered
and
i
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
my
but
speak
the
word
and
my
servant
shall
be
for
i
am
a
man
under
having
soldiers
under
and
i
say
to
this
and
he
and
to
and
he
and
to
my
do
and
he
doeth
when
jesus
heard
he
and
said
to
them
that
verily
i
say
unto
i
have
not
found
so
great
not
in
and
i
say
unto
that
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
and
shall
sit
down
with
and
and
in
the
kingdom
of
but
the
children
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
cast
out
into
outer
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
and
jesus
said
unto
the
go
thy
and
as
thou
hast
be
it
done
unto
and
his
servant
was
healed
in
the
selfsame
and
when
jesus
was
come
into
he
saw
his
mother
and
sick
of
a
and
he
touched
her
and
the
fever
left
and
she
and
ministered
unto
when
the
even
was
they
brought
unto
him
many
that
were
possessed
with
and
he
cast
out
the
spirits
with
and
healed
all
that
were
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
himself
took
our
and
bare
now
when
jesus
saw
great
multitudes
about
he
gave
commandment
to
depart
unto
the
other
and
a
certain
scribe
and
said
unto
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
and
jesus
saith
unto
the
foxes
have
and
the
birds
of
the
air
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
and
another
of
his
disciples
said
unto
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
but
jesus
said
unto
follow
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
and
when
he
was
entered
into
a
his
disciples
followed
there
arose
a
great
tempest
in
the
insomuch
that
the
ship
was
covered
with
the
but
he
was
and
his
disciples
came
to
and
awoke
save
we
and
he
saith
unto
why
are
ye
o
ye
of
little
then
he
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
and
there
was
a
great
but
the
men
what
manner
of
man
is
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
and
when
he
was
come
to
the
other
side
into
the
country
of
the
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
coming
out
of
the
exceeding
so
that
no
man
might
pass
by
that
they
cried
what
have
we
to
do
with
thou
son
of
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
and
there
was
a
good
way
off
from
them
an
herd
of
many
swine
so
the
devils
besought
if
thou
cast
us
suffer
us
to
go
away
into
the
herd
of
and
he
said
unto
and
when
they
were
come
they
went
into
the
herd
of
the
whole
herd
of
swine
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
and
perished
in
the
and
they
that
kept
them
and
went
their
ways
into
the
and
told
every
and
what
was
befallen
to
the
possessed
of
the
the
whole
city
came
out
to
meet
and
when
they
saw
they
besought
that
he
would
depart
out
of
their
chapter
and
he
entered
into
a
and
passed
and
came
into
his
own
they
brought
to
him
a
man
sick
of
the
lying
on
a
and
jesus
seeing
their
faith
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
be
of
good
thy
sins
be
forgiven
certain
of
the
scribes
said
within
this
and
jesus
knowing
their
thoughts
wherefore
think
ye
evil
in
your
for
whether
is
to
sins
be
forgiven
or
to
and
but
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
saith
he
to
the
sick
of
the
take
up
thy
and
go
unto
thine
and
he
and
departed
to
his
but
when
the
multitudes
saw
they
and
glorified
which
had
given
such
power
unto
and
as
jesus
passed
forth
from
he
saw
a
named
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
and
he
saith
unto
follow
and
he
and
followed
and
it
came
to
as
jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
many
publicans
and
sinners
came
and
sat
down
with
him
and
his
and
when
the
pharisees
saw
they
said
unto
his
why
eateth
your
master

it
is
enough
for
the
disciple
that
he
be

the
servant
as
his
if
they
have
called

how
much
more

there
is
nothing

i
tell
you
in
speak
ye
in

what
ye
hear
in

preach
ye
upon

fear
not
them
which
kill
the
but
are
not
able
to
kill
the
but
rather
fear
him
which
is
able
to
destroy
both
soul
and
body
in
are
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
a

one
of

shall
not
fall
on
the

without

the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
fear
ye
not
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
whosoever
therefore
shall
confess
me
before
him
will
i
confess
also
before
my
father
which
is
in
but
whosoever
shall
deny
me
before
him
will
i
also
deny
before
my
father
which
is
in
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
send
peace
on
i
came
not
to
send
but
a
for
i
am
come
to
set
a
man
at
variance
against
his
and
the
daughter
against
her
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
and
a
foes
they
of
his
own
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
and
he
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
and
he
that
taketh
not
his
and
followeth
after
is
not
worthy
of
he
that
findeth
his
life
shall
lose
and
he
that
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
he
that
receiveth
you
receiveth
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
he
that
receiveth
a
prophet
in
the
name
of
a
prophet
shall
receive
a
and
he
that
receiveth
a
righteous
man
in
the
name
of
a
righteous
man
shall
receive
a
righteous
and
whosoever
shall
give
to
drink
unto
one
of
these
little
ones
a
cup
of
cold
only
in
the
name
of
a
verily
i
say
unto
he
shall
in
no
wise
lose
his
chapter
and
it
came
to
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
twelve
he
departed
thence
to
teach
and
to
preach
in
their
now
when
john
had
heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of
he
sent
two
of
his
and
said
unto
art
thou
he
that
should
or
do
we
look
for
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
go
and
shew
john
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
the
blind
receive
their
and
the
lame
the
lepers
are
and
the
deaf
the
dead
are
raised
and
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
and
blessed
is
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
and
as
they
jesus
began
to
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
what
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
to
a
reed
shaken
with
the
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
a
man
clothed
in
soft
they
that
wear
soft
are
in
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
a
i
say
unto
and
more
than
a
for
this
is
of
whom
it
is
i
send
my
messenger
before
thy
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
verily
i
say
unto
among
them
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
risen
a
greater
than
john
the
notwithstanding
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
and
from
the
days
of
john
the
baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
and
the
violent
take
it
by
for
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
and
if
ye
will
receive
this
is
which
was
for
to
he
that
hath
ears
to
let
him
but
whereunto
shall
i
liken
this
it
is
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
and
calling
unto
their
and
we
have
piped
unto
and
ye
have
not
we
have
mourned
unto
and
ye
have
not
for
john
came
neither
eating
nor
and
they
he
hath
a
the
son
of
man
came
eating
and
and
they
behold
a
man
and
a
a
friend
of
publicans
and
but
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
then
began
he
to
upbraid
the
cities
wherein
most
of
his
mighty
works
were
because
they
repented
woe
unto
woe
unto
for
if
the
mighty
which
were
done
in
had
been
done
in
tyre
and
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
in
sackcloth
and
but
i
say
unto
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
tyre
and
sidon
at
the
day
of
than
for
and
which
art
exalted
unto
shalt
be
brought
down
to
for
if
the
mighty
which
have
been
done
in
had
been
done
in
it
would
have
remained
until
this
but
i
say
unto
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
in
the
day
of
than
for
at
that
time
jesus
answered
and
i
thank
o
lord
of
heaven
and
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
even
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
all
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
and
no
man
knoweth
the
but
the
neither
knoweth
any
man
the
save
the
and
to
whomsoever
the
son
will
reveal
come
unto
all
that
labour
and
are
heavy
and
i
will
give
you
take
my
yoke
upon
and
learn
of
for
i
am
meek
and
lowly
in
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
for
my
yoke
and
my
burden
is
chapter
at
that
time
jesus
went
on
the
sabbath
day
through
the
and
his
disciples
were
an
and
began
to
pluck
the
ears
of
and
to
but
when
the
pharisees
saw
they
said
unto
thy
disciples
do
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
upon
the
sabbath
but
he
said
unto
have
ye
not
read
what
david
when
he
was
an
and
they
that
were
with
how
he
entered
into
the
house
of
and
did
eat
the
which
was
not
lawful
for
him
to
neither
for
them
which
were
with
but
only
for
the
or
have
ye
not
read
in
the
how
that
on
the
sabbath
days
the
priests
in
the
temple
profane
the
and
are
but
i
say
unto
that
in
this
place
is
greater
than
the
but
if
ye
had
known
what
i
will
have
and
not
ye
would
not
have
condemned
the
for
the
son
of
man
is
lord
even
of
the
sabbath
and
when
he
was
departed
he
went
into
their
there
was
a
man
which
had
hand
and
they
asked
is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
that
they
might
accuse
and
he
said
unto
what
man
shall
there
be
among
that
shall
have
one
and
if
it
fall
into
a
pit
on
the
sabbath
will
he
not
lay
hold
on
and
lift
how
much
then
is
a
man
better
than
a
wherefore
it
is
lawful
to
do
well
on
the
sabbath
then
saith
he
to
the
stretch
forth
thine
and
he
stretched
and
it
was
restored
like
as
the
then
the
pharisees
went
and
held
a
council
against
how
they
might
destroy
but
when
jesus
knew
he
withdrew
himself
from
and
great
multitudes
followed
and
he
healed
them
and
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
behold
my
whom
i
have
my
in
whom
my
soul
is
well
i
will
put
my
spirit
upon
and
he
shall
shew
judgment
to
the
he
shall
not
nor
neither
shall
any
man
hear
his
voice
in
the
a
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
and
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
till
he
send
forth
judgment
unto
and
in
his
name
shall
the
gentiles
then
was
brought
unto
him
one
possessed
with
a
and
and
he
healed
insomuch
that
the
blind
and
dumb
both
spake
and
and
all
the
people
were
and
is
not
this
the
son
of
but
when
the
pharisees
heard
they
this
doth
not
cast
out
but
by
beelzebub
the
prince
of
the
and
jesus
knew
their
and
said
unto
every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
and
every
city
or
house
divided
against
itself
shall
not
and
if
satan
cast
out
he
is
divided
against
how
shall
then
his
kingdom
and
if
i
by
beelzebub
cast
out
by
whom
do
your
children
cast
therefore
they
shall
be
your
but
if
i
cast
out
devils
by
the
spirit
of
then
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
unto
or
else
how
can
one
enter
into
a
strong
and
spoil
his
except
he
first
bind
the
strong
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
he
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth
wherefore
i
say
unto
all
manner
of
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
be
forgiven
unto
but
the
blasphemy
the
ghost
shall
not
be
forgiven
unto
and
whosoever
speaketh
a
word
against
the
son
of
it
shall
be
forgiven
but
whosoever
speaketh
against
the
holy
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
neither
in
this
neither
in
the
to
either
make
the
tree
and
his
fruit
or
else
make
the
tree
and
his
fruit
for
the
tree
is
known
by
o
generation
of
how
can
being
speak
good
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
a
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
the
heart
bringeth
forth
good
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
bringeth
forth
evil
but
i
say
unto
that
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
they
shall
give
account
thereof
in
the
day
of
for
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
and
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
then
certain
of
the
scribes
and
of
the
pharisees
we
would
see
a
sign
from
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
an
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
to
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
for
as
jonas
was
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
so
shall
the
son
of
man
be
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
heart
of
the
the
men
of
nineveh
shall
rise
in
judgment
with
this
and
shall
condemn
because
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
a
greater
than
jonas
the
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
and
shall
condemn
for
she
came
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
a
greater
than
solomon
when
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
he
walketh
through
dry
seeking
and
findeth
then
he
i
will
return
into
my
house
from
whence
i
came
and
when
he
is
he
findeth
and
then
goeth
and
taketh
with
himself
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
and
they
enter
in
and
dwell
and
the
last
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
even
so
shall
it
be
also
unto
this
wicked
while
he
yet
talked
to
the
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
desiring
to
speak
with
then
one
said
unto
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
desiring
to
speak
with
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
who
is
my
and
who
are
my
and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
his
and
behold
my
mother
and
my
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
the
same
is
my
and
and
chapter
the
same
day
went
jesus
out
of
the
and
sat
by
the
sea
and
great
multitudes
were
gathered
together
unto
so
that
he
went
into
a
and
and
the
whole
multitude
stood
on
the
and
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
in
a
sower
went
forth
to
and
when
he
some
fell
by
the
way
and
the
fowls
came
and
devoured
them
some
fell
upon
stony
where
they
had
not
much
and
forthwith
they
sprung
because
they
had
no
deepness
of
and
when
the
sun
was
they
were
and
because
they
had
no
they
withered
and
some
fell
among
and
the
thorns
sprung
and
choked
but
other
fell
into
good
and
brought
forth
some
an
some
some
who
hath
ears
to
let
him
and
the
disciples
and
said
unto
why
speakest
thou
unto
them
in
he
answered
and
said
unto
because
it
is
given
unto
you
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
but
to
them
it
is
not
for
whosoever
to
him
shall
be
and
he
shall
have
more
but
whosoever
hath
from
him
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
he
therefore
speak
i
to
them
in
because
they
seeing
see
and
hearing
they
hear
neither
do
they
and
in
them
is
fulfilled
the
prophecy
of
which
by
hearing
ye
shall
and
shall
not
and
seeing
ye
shall
and
shall
not
for
this
heart
is
waxed
and
ears
are
dull
of
and
their
eyes
they
have
lest
at
any
time
they
should
see
with
and
hear
with
and
should
understand
with
and
should
be
and
i
should
heal
but
blessed
your
for
they
and
your
for
they
for
verily
i
say
unto
that
many
prophets
and
righteous
have
desired
to
see
which
ye
and
have
not
seen
and
to
hear
which
ye
and
have
not
heard
hear
ye
therefore
the
parable
of
the
when
any
one
heareth
the
word
of
the
and
understandeth
then
cometh
the
wicked
and
catcheth
away
that
which
was
sown
in
his
this
is
he
which
received
seed
by
the
way
but
he
that
received
the
seed
into
stony
the
same
is
he
that
heareth
the
and
anon
with
joy
receiveth
yet
hath
he
not
root
in
but
dureth
for
a
for
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
because
of
the
by
and
by
he
is
he
also
that
received
seed
among
the
thorns
is
he
that
heareth
the
and
the
care
of
this
and
the
deceitfulness
of
choke
the
and
he
becometh
but
he
that
received
seed
into
the
good
ground
is
he
that
heareth
the
and
understandeth
which
also
beareth
and
bringeth
some
an
some
some
another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
likened
unto
a
man
which
sowed
good
seed
in
his
but
while
men
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
among
the
and
went
his
but
when
the
blade
was
sprung
and
brought
forth
then
appeared
the
tares
so
the
servants
of
the
householder
came
and
said
unto
didst
not
thou
sow
good
seed
in
thy
from
whence
then
hath
it
he
said
unto
an
enemy
hath
done
the
servants
said
unto
wilt
thou
then
that
we
go
and
gather
them
but
he
lest
while
ye
gather
up
the
ye
root
up
also
the
wheat
with
let
both
grow
together
until
the
and
in
the
time
of
harvest
i
will
say
to
the
gather
ye
together
first
the
and
bind
them
in
bundles
to
burn
but
gather
the
wheat
into
my
another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
to
a
grain
of
mustard
which
a
man
and
sowed
in
his
which
indeed
is
the
least
of
all
but
when
it
is
it
is
the
greatest
among
and
becometh
a
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
come
and
lodge
in
the
branches
another
parable
spake
he
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
which
a
woman
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
till
the
whole
was
all
these
things
spake
jesus
unto
the
multitude
in
and
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
i
will
open
my
mouth
in
i
will
utter
things
which
have
been
kept
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
then
jesus
sent
the
multitude
and
went
into
the
and
his
disciples
came
unto
declare
unto
us
the
parable
of
the
tares
of
the
he
answered
and
said
unto
he
that
soweth
the
good
seed
is
the
son
of
the
field
is
the
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
the
enemy
that
sowed
them
is
the
the
harvest
is
the
end
of
the
and
the
reapers
are
the
as
therefore
the
tares
are
gathered
and
burned
in
the
so
shall
it
be
in
the
end
of
this
the
son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
and
they
shall
gather
out
of
his
kingdom
all
things
that
and
them
which
do
and
shall
cast
them
into
a
furnace
of
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
who
hath
ears
to
let
him
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
treasure
hid
in
a
the
which
when
a
man
hath
he
and
for
joy
thereof
goeth
and
selleth
all
that
he
and
buyeth
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
merchant
seeking
goodly
when
he
had
found
one
pearl
of
great
went
and
sold
all
that
he
and
bought
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
that
was
cast
into
the
and
gathered
of
every
when
it
was
they
drew
to
and
sat
and
gathered
the
good
into
but
cast
the
bad
so
shall
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
the
angels
shall
come
and
sever
the
wicked
from
among
the
and
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
of
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
jesus
saith
unto
have
ye
understood
all
these
they
say
unto
then
said
he
unto
therefore
every
scribe
instructed
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
an
which
bringeth
forth
out
of
his
treasure
new
and
and
it
came
to
when
jesus
had
finished
these
he
departed
and
when
he
was
come
into
his
own
he
taught
them
in
their
insomuch
that
they
were
and
whence
hath
this
this
and
mighty
is
not
this
the
is
not
his
mother
called
and
his
and
and
and
and
his
are
they
not
all
with
whence
then
hath
this
all
these
and
they
were
offended
in
but
jesus
said
unto
a
prophet
is
not
without
save
in
his
own
and
in
his
own
and
he
did
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
chapter
at
that
time
herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
the
fame
of
and
said
unto
his
this
is
john
the
he
is
risen
from
the
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
for
herod
had
laid
hold
on
and
bound
and
put
in
prison
for
his
brother
for
john
said
unto
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
and
when
he
would
have
put
him
to
he
feared
the
because
they
counted
him
as
a
but
when
birthday
was
the
daughter
of
herodias
danced
before
and
pleased
whereupon
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
and
being
before
instructed
of
her
give
me
here
john
head
in
a
and
the
king
was
nevertheless
for
the
and
them
which
sat
with
him
at
he
commanded
to
be
given
and
he
and
beheaded
john
in
the
and
his
head
was
brought
in
a
and
given
to
the
and
she
brought
to
her
and
his
disciples
and
took
up
the
and
buried
and
went
and
told
when
jesus
heard
he
departed
thence
by
ship
into
a
desert
place
and
when
the
people
had
heard
they
followed
him
on
foot
out
of
the
and
jesus
went
and
saw
a
great
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
and
he
healed
their
and
when
it
was
his
disciples
came
to
this
is
a
desert
and
the
time
is
now
send
the
multitude
that
they
may
go
into
the
and
buy
themselves
but
jesus
said
unto
they
need
not
give
ye
them
to
and
they
say
unto
we
have
here
but
five
and
two
he
bring
them
hither
to
and
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
and
took
the
five
and
the
two
and
looking
up
to
he
and
and
gave
the
loaves
to
and
the
disciples
to
the
and
they
did
all
and
were
and
they
took
up
of
the
fragments
that
remained
twelve
baskets
and
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
five
thousand
beside
women
and
and
straightway
jesus
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
a
and
to
go
before
him
unto
the
other
while
he
sent
the
multitudes
and
when
he
had
sent
the
multitudes
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
apart
to
and
when
the
evening
was
he
was
there
but
the
ship
was
now
in
the
midst
of
the
tossed
with
for
the
wind
was
and
in
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
jesus
went
unto
walking
on
the
and
when
the
disciples
saw
him
walking
on
the
they
were
it
is
a
and
they
cried
out
for
but
straightway
jesus
spake
unto
be
of
good
it
is
be
not
and
peter
answered
him
and
if
it
be
bid
me
come
unto
thee
on
the
and
he
and
when
peter
was
come
down
out
of
the
he
walked
on
the
to
go
to
but
when
he
saw
the
wind
he
was
and
beginning
to
he
save
and
immediately
jesus
stretched
forth
and
caught
and
said
unto
o
thou
of
little
wherefore
didst
thou
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
the
wind
then
they
that
were
in
the
ship
came
and
worshipped
of
a
truth
thou
art
the
son
of
and
when
they
were
gone
they
came
into
the
land
of
and
when
the
men
of
that
place
had
knowledge
of
they
sent
out
into
all
that
country
round
and
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
and
besought
him
that
they
might
only
touch
the
hem
of
his
and
as
many
as
touched
were
made
perfectly
chapter
then
came
to
jesus
scribes
and
which
were
of
why
do
thy
disciples
transgress
the
tradition
of
the
for
they
wash
not
their
hands
when
they
eat
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
why
do
ye
also
transgress
the
commandment
of
god
by
your
for
god
honour
thy
father
and
he
that
curseth
father
or
let
him
die
the
but
ye
whosoever
shall
say
to
father
or
a
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
and
honour
not
his
father
or
his
shall
be
thus
have
ye
made
the
commandment
of
god
of
none
effect
by
your
well
did
esaias
prophesy
of
this
people
draweth
nigh
unto
me
with
their
and
honoureth
me
with
but
their
heart
is
far
from
but
in
vain
they
do
worship
teaching
doctrines
the
commandments
of
and
he
called
the
and
said
unto
and
not
that
which
goeth
into
the
mouth
defileth
a
but
that
which
cometh
out
of
the
this
defileth
a
then
came
his
and
said
unto
knowest
thou
that
the
pharisees
were
after
they
heard
this
but
he
answered
and
every
which
my
heavenly
father
hath
not
shall
be
rooted
let
them
they
be
blind
leaders
of
the
and
if
the
blind
lead
the
both
shall
fall
into
the
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
declare
unto
us
this
and
jesus
are
ye
also
yet
without
do
not
ye
yet
that
whatsoever
entereth
in
at
the
mouth
goeth
into
the
and
is
cast
out
into
the
but
those
things
which
proceed
out
of
the
mouth
come
forth
from
the
and
they
defile
the
for
out
of
the
heart
proceed
evil
false
these
are
which
defile
a
but
to
eat
with
unwashen
hands
defileth
not
a
then
jesus
went
and
departed
into
the
coasts
of
tyre
and
a
woman
of
canaan
came
out
of
the
same
and
cried
unto
have
mercy
on
o
son
of
my
daughter
is
grievously
vexed
with
a
but
he
answered
her
not
a
and
his
disciples
came
and
besought
send
her
for
she
crieth
after
but
he
answered
and
i
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
then
came
she
and
worshipped
help
but
he
answered
and
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
and
to
cast
to
and
she
yet
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
their
then
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
o
great
thy
be
it
unto
thee
even
as
thou
and
her
daughter
was
made
whole
from
that
very
and
jesus
departed
from
and
came
nigh
unto
the
sea
of
and
went
up
into
a
and
sat
down
and
great
multitudes
came
unto
having
with
them
that
and
many
and
cast
them
down
at
and
he
healed
insomuch
that
the
multitude
when
they
saw
the
dumb
to
the
maimed
to
be
the
lame
to
and
the
blind
to
and
they
glorified
the
god
of
then
jesus
called
his
disciples
and
i
have
compassion
on
the
because
they
continue
with
me
now
three
and
have
nothing
to
and
i
will
not
send
them
away
lest
they
faint
in
the
and
his
disciples
say
unto
whence
should
we
have
so
much
bread
in
the
as
to
fill
so
great
a
and
jesus
saith
unto
how
many
loaves
have
and
they
and
a
few
little
and
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
and
he
took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
and
gave
and
brake
and
gave
to
his
and
the
disciples
to
the
and
they
did
all
and
were
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
that
was
left
seven
baskets
and
they
that
did
eat
were
four
thousand
beside
women
and
and
he
sent
away
the
and
took
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
chapter
the
pharisees
also
with
the
sadducees
and
tempting
desired
him
that
he
would
shew
them
a
sign
from
he
answered
and
said
unto
when
it
is
ye
will
fair
for
the
sky
is
and
in
the
will
foul
weather
to
for
the
sky
is
red
and
o
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
but
can
ye
not
the
signs
of
the
a
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
and
he
left
and
and
when
his
disciples
were
come
to
the
other
they
had
forgotten
to
take
then
jesus
said
unto
take
heed
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
and
they
reasoned
among
because
we
have
taken
no
when
jesus
he
said
unto
o
ye
of
little
why
reason
ye
among
because
ye
have
brought
no
do
ye
not
yet
neither
remember
the
five
loaves
of
the
five
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
neither
the
seven
loaves
of
the
four
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand
that
i
spake
not
to
you
concerning
that
ye
should
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
then
understood
they
how
that
he
bade
not
beware
of
the
leaven
of
but
of
the
doctrine
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
when
jesus
came
into
the
coasts
of
caesarea
he
asked
his
whom
do
men
say
that
i
the
son
of
man
and
they
some
that
thou
john
the
and
or
one
of
the
he
saith
unto
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
and
simon
peter
answered
and
thou
art
the
the
son
of
the
living
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
blessed
art
simon
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
unto
but
my
father
which
is
in
and
i
say
also
unto
that
thou
art
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
then
charged
he
his
disciples
that
they
should
tell
no
man
that
he
was
jesus
the
from
that
time
forth
began
jesus
to
shew
unto
his
how
that
he
must
go
unto
and
suffer
many
things
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
and
be
and
be
raised
again
the
third
then
peter
took
and
began
to
rebuke
be
it
far
from
this
shall
not
be
unto
but
he
and
said
unto
get
thee
behind
thou
art
an
offence
unto
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
but
those
that
be
of
then
said
jesus
unto
his
if
any
will
come
after
let
him
deny
and
take
up
his
and
follow
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
and
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
for
what
is
a
man
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
and
lose
his
own
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
for
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
his
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
verily
i
say
unto
there
be
some
standing
which
shall
not
taste
of
till
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
his
chapter
and
after
six
days
jesus
taketh
and
john
his
and
bringeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
and
was
transfigured
before
and
his
face
did
shine
as
the
and
his
raiment
was
white
as
the
there
appeared
unto
them
moses
and
elias
talking
with
then
answered
and
said
unto
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
if
thou
let
us
make
here
three
one
for
and
one
for
and
one
for
while
he
yet
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
and
behold
a
voice
out
of
the
which
this
is
my
beloved
in
whom
i
am
well
hear
ye
and
when
the
disciples
heard
they
fell
on
their
and
were
sore
and
jesus
came
and
touched
and
and
be
not
and
when
they
had
lifted
up
their
they
saw
no
save
jesus
and
as
they
came
down
from
the
jesus
charged
tell
the
vision
to
no
until
the
son
of
man
be
risen
again
from
the
and
his
disciples
asked
why
then
say
the
scribes
that
elias
must
first
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
elias
truly
shall
first
and
restore
all
but
i
say
unto
that
elias
is
come
and
they
knew
him
but
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
likewise
shall
also
the
son
of
man
suffer
of
then
the
disciples
understood
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
john
the
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
there
came
to
him
a
kneeling
down
to
and
have
mercy
on
my
for
he
is
and
sore
for
ofttimes
he
falleth
into
the
and
oft
into
the
and
i
brought
him
to
thy
and
they
could
not
cure
then
jesus
answered
and
o
faithless
and
perverse
how
long
shall
i
be
with
how
long
shall
i
suffer
bring
him
hither
to
and
jesus
rebuked
the
and
he
departed
out
of
and
the
child
was
cured
from
that
very
then
came
the
disciples
to
jesus
and
why
could
not
we
cast
him
and
jesus
said
unto
because
of
your
for
verily
i
say
unto
if
ye
have
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
ye
shall
say
unto
this
remove
hence
to
yonder
and
it
shall
and
nothing
shall
be
impossible
unto
howbeit
this
kind
goeth
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
and
while
they
abode
in
jesus
said
unto
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
and
they
shall
kill
and
the
third
day
he
shall
be
raised
and
they
were
exceeding
and
when
they
were
come
to
they
that
received
tribute
came
to
and
doth
not
your
master
pay
he
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
jesus
prevented
what
thinkest
of
whom
do
the
kings
of
the
earth
take
custom
or
of
their
own
or
of
peter
saith
unto
of
jesus
saith
unto
then
are
the
children
lest
we
should
offend
go
thou
to
the
and
cast
an
and
take
up
the
fish
that
first
cometh
and
when
thou
hast
opened
his
thou
shalt
find
a
piece
of
that
and
give
unto
them
for
me
and
chapter
at
the
same
time
came
the
disciples
unto
who
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
and
jesus
called
a
little
child
unto
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
and
verily
i
say
unto
except
ye
be
and
become
as
little
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
whosoever
therefore
shall
humble
himself
as
this
little
the
same
is
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
and
whoso
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
but
whoso
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
which
believe
in
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
and
he
were
drowned
in
the
depth
of
the
woe
unto
the
world
because
of
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offence
wherefore
if
thy
hand
or
thy
foot
offend
cut
them
and
cast
from
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
halt
or
rather
than
having
two
hands
or
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
everlasting
and
if
thine
eye
offend
pluck
it
and
cast
from
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
with
one
rather
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
take
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
for
i
say
unto
that
in
heaven
their
angels
do
always
behold
the
face
of
my
father
which
is
in
for
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
save
that
which
was
how
think
if
a
man
have
an
hundred
and
one
of
them
be
gone
doth
he
not
leave
the
ninety
and
and
goeth
into
the
and
seeketh
that
which
is
gone
and
if
so
be
that
he
find
verily
i
say
unto
he
rejoiceth
more
of
that
than
of
the
ninety
and
nine
which
went
not
even
so
it
is
not
the
will
of
your
father
which
is
in
that
one
of
these
little
ones
should
moreover
if
thy
brother
shall
trespass
against
go
and
tell
him
his
fault
between
thee
and
him
if
he
shall
hear
thou
hast
gained
thy
but
if
he
will
not
hear
take
with
thee
one
or
two
that
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
word
may
be
and
if
he
shall
neglect
to
hear
tell
unto
the
but
if
he
neglect
to
hear
the
let
him
be
unto
thee
as
an
heathen
man
and
a
verily
i
say
unto
whatsoever
ye
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
again
i
say
unto
that
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
any
thing
that
they
shall
it
shall
be
done
for
them
of
my
father
which
is
in
for
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
then
came
peter
to
and
how
oft
shall
my
brother
sin
against
and
i
forgive
till
seven
jesus
saith
unto
i
say
not
unto
until
seven
until
seventy
times
therefore
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
likened
unto
a
certain
which
would
take
account
of
his
and
when
he
had
begun
to
one
was
brought
unto
which
owed
him
ten
thousand
but
forasmuch
as
he
had
not
to
his
lord
commanded
him
to
be
and
his
and
and
all
that
he
and
payment
to
be
the
servant
therefore
fell
and
worshipped
have
patience
with
and
i
will
pay
thee
then
the
lord
of
that
servant
was
moved
with
and
loosed
and
forgave
him
the
but
the
same
servant
went
and
found
one
of
his
which
owed
him
an
hundred
and
he
laid
hands
on
and
took
by
the
pay
me
that
thou
and
his
fellowservant
fell
down
at
his
and
besought
have
patience
with
and
i
will
pay
thee
and
he
would
but
went
and
cast
him
into
till
he
should
pay
the
so
when
his
fellowservants
saw
what
was
they
were
very
and
came
and
told
unto
their
lord
all
that
was
then
his
after
that
he
had
called
said
unto
o
thou
wicked
i
forgave
thee
all
that
because
thou
desiredst
shouldest
not
thou
also
have
had
compassion
on
thy
even
as
i
had
pity
on
and
his
lord
was
and
delivered
him
to
the
till
he
should
pay
all
that
was
due
unto
so
likewise
shall
my
heavenly
father
do
also
unto
if
ye
from
your
hearts
forgive
not
every
one
his
brother
their
chapter
and
it
came
to
when
jesus
had
finished
these
he
departed
from
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
judaea
beyond
and
great
multitudes
followed
and
he
healed
them
the
pharisees
also
came
unto
tempting
and
saying
unto
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
for
every
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
have
ye
not
that
he
which
made
at
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
and
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
and
shall
cleave
to
his
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
wherefore
they
are
no
more
but
one
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
let
not
man
put
they
say
unto
why
did
moses
then
command
to
give
a
writing
of
and
to
put
her
he
saith
unto
moses
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
and
i
say
unto
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
except
for
and
shall
marry
committeth
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit
his
disciples
say
unto
if
the
case
of
the
man
be
so
with
it
is
not
good
to
but
he
said
unto
all
cannot
receive
this
save
to
whom
it
is
for
there
are
some
which
were
so
born
from
and
there
are
some
which
were
made
eunuchs
of
and
there
be
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
he
that
is
able
to
receive
let
him
receive
then
were
there
brought
unto
him
little
that
he
should
put
hands
on
and
and
the
disciples
rebuked
but
jesus
suffer
little
and
forbid
them
to
come
unto
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
and
he
laid
hands
on
and
departed
one
came
and
said
unto
good
what
good
thing
shall
i
that
i
may
have
eternal
and
he
said
unto
why
callest
thou
me
none
good
but
but
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
keep
the
he
saith
unto
jesus
thou
shalt
do
no
thou
shalt
not
commit
thou
shalt
not
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
honour
thy
father
and
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
the
young
man
saith
unto
all
these
things
have
i
kept
from
my
youth
what
lack
i
jesus
said
unto
if
thou
wilt
be
go
sell
that
thou
and
give
to
the
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
and
come
follow
but
when
the
young
man
heard
that
he
went
away
for
he
had
great
then
said
jesus
unto
his
verily
i
say
unto
that
a
rich
man
shall
hardly
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
and
again
i
say
unto
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
when
his
disciples
heard
they
were
exceedingly
who
then
can
be
but
jesus
beheld
and
said
unto
with
men
this
is
but
with
god
all
things
are
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
we
have
forsaken
and
followed
what
shall
we
have
and
jesus
said
unto
verily
i
say
unto
that
ye
which
have
followed
in
the
regeneration
when
the
son
of
man
shall
sit
in
the
throne
of
his
ye
also
shall
sit
upon
twelve
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
and
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
or
or
or
or
or
or
or
for
my
shall
receive
an
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
but
many
first
shall
be
and
the
last
chapter
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
an
which
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
hire
labourers
into
his
and
when
he
had
agreed
with
the
labourers
for
a
penny
a
he
sent
them
into
his
and
he
went
out
about
the
third
and
saw
others
standing
idle
in
the
and
said
unto
go
ye
also
into
the
and
whatsoever
is
right
i
will
give
and
they
went
their
again
he
went
out
about
the
sixth
and
ninth
and
did
and
about
the
eleventh
hour
he
went
and
found
others
standing
and
saith
unto
why
stand
ye
here
all
the
day
they
say
unto
because
no
man
hath
hired
he
saith
unto
go
ye
also
into
the
and
whatsoever
is
shall
ye
so
when
even
was
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saith
unto
his
call
the
and
give
them
beginning
from
the
last
unto
the
and
when
they
came
that
about
the
eleventh
they
received
every
man
a
but
when
the
first
they
supposed
that
they
should
have
received
and
they
likewise
received
every
man
a
and
when
they
had
received
they
murmured
against
the
goodman
of
the
these
last
have
wrought
one
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
which
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
but
he
answered
one
of
and
i
do
thee
no
didst
not
thou
agree
with
me
for
a
take
thine
and
go
thy
i
will
give
unto
this
even
as
unto
is
it
not
lawful
for
me
to
do
what
i
will
with
mine
is
thine
eye
because
i
am
so
the
last
shall
be
and
the
first
for
many
be
but
few
and
jesus
going
up
to
jerusalem
took
the
twelve
disciples
apart
in
the
and
said
unto
we
go
up
to
and
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
unto
the
chief
priests
and
unto
the
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
gentiles
to
and
to
and
to
crucify
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
then
came
to
him
the
mother
of
children
with
her
worshipping
and
desiring
a
certain
thing
of
and
he
said
unto
what
wilt
she
saith
unto
grant
that
these
my
two
sons
may
the
one
on
thy
right
and
the
other
on
the
in
thy
but
jesus
answered
and
ye
know
not
what
ye
are
ye
able
to
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
shall
drink
and
to
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
they
say
unto
we
are
and
he
saith
unto
ye
shall
drink
indeed
of
my
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
but
to
sit
on
my
right
and
on
my
is
not
mine
to
but
shall
be
given
to
for
whom
it
is
prepared
of
my
and
when
the
ten
heard
they
were
moved
with
indignation
against
the
two
but
jesus
called
them
and
ye
know
that
the
princes
of
the
gentiles
exercise
dominion
over
and
they
that
are
great
exercise
authority
upon
but
it
shall
not
be
so
among
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
let
him
be
your
and
whosoever
will
be
chief
among
let
him
be
your
even
as
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
but
to
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
and
as
they
departed
from
a
great
multitude
followed
two
blind
men
sitting
by
the
way
when
they
heard
that
jesus
passed
cried
have
mercy
on
o
son
of
and
the
multitude
rebuked
because
they
should
hold
their
but
they
cried
the
have
mercy
on
o
son
of
and
jesus
stood
and
called
and
what
will
ye
that
i
shall
do
unto
they
say
unto
that
our
eyes
may
be
so
jesus
had
compassion
and
touched
their
and
immediately
their
eyes
received

and
presently
the

when
the

saw
they
how

is
the
fig

jesus
answered
and
said
unto
verily

say
unto
if
ye
have
and
doubt
ye
shall
not

do
this
is
to
the
fig
but
also
if

shall
say
unto
this
be

and
be
thou
cast
into
the
it
shall
be
and
all
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask

when
he
was
come
into
the
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
came
unto
him
as
he
was
and
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
and
who
gave
thee
this
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
i
also
will
ask
you
one
which
if
ye
tell
i
in
like
wise
will
tell
you
by
what
authority

from
or
of
and
they
reasoned
with
if
we
shall
from
he
will
say
unto
why
did
ye
not
then
believe
but
if
we
shall
of
we
fear
the
for
all
hold
john
as
a
and
they
answered
and
we
cannot
and
he
said
unto
neither

i
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
but
what
think
a
man
had
two
and
he
came
to
the
and
go
work
to
day
in
my
he
answered
and
i
will
but
afterward
he
and
and
he
came
to
the
and
said
and
he
answered
and
i
and
went
whether
of
them
twain
did
the
will
of
they
say
unto
the
jesus
saith
unto
verily
i
say
unto
that
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
go
into
the
kingdom
of
god
before
for
john
came
unto
you
in
the
way
of
and
ye
believed
him
but
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
believed
and
when
ye
had
seen
repented
not
that
ye
might
believe
hear
another
there
was
a
certain
which
planted
a
and
hedged
it
round
and
digged
a
winepress
in
and
built
a
and
let
it
out
to
and
went
into
a
far
and
when
the
time
of
the
fruit
drew
he
sent
his
servants
to
the
that
they
might
receive
the
fruits
of
and
the
husbandmen
took
his
and
beat
and
killed
and
stoned
he
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
and
they
did
unto
them
but
last
of
all
he
sent
unto
them
his
they
will
reverence
my
but
when
the
husbandmen
saw
the
they
said
among
this
is
the
let
us
kill
and
let
us
seize
on
his
and
they
caught
and
cast
out
of
the
and
slew
when
the
lord
therefore
of
the
vineyard
what
will
he
do
unto
those
they
say
unto
he
will
miserably
destroy
those
wicked
and
will
let
out
vineyard
unto
other
which
shall
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
jesus
saith
unto
did
ye
never
read
in
the
the
stone
which
the
builders
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
this
is
the
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
therefore
say
i
unto
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
be
taken
from
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
and
whosoever
shall
fall
on
this
stone
shall
be
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
it
will
grind
him
to
and
when
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
had
heard
his
they
perceived
that
he
spake
of
but
when
they
sought
to
lay
hands
on
they
feared
the
because
they
took
him
for
a
chapter
and
jesus
answered
and
spake
unto
them
again
by
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
certain
which
made
a
marriage
for
his
and
sent
forth
his
servants
to
call
them
that
were
bidden
to
the
and
they
would
not
he
sent
forth
other
tell
them
which
are
i
have
prepared
my
my
oxen
and
fatlings
and
all
things
come
unto
the
but
they
made
light
of
and
went
their
one
to
his
another
to
his
and
the
remnant
took
his
and
entreated
and
slew
but
when
the
king
heard
he
was
and
he
sent
forth
his
and
destroyed
those
and
burned
up
their
then
saith
he
to
his
the
wedding
is
but
they
which
were
bidden
were
not
go
ye
therefore
into
the
and
as
many
as
ye
shall
bid
to
the
so
those
servants
went
out
into
the
and
gathered
together
all
as
many
as
they
both
bad
and
and
the
wedding
was
furnished
with
and
when
the
king
came
in
to
see
the
he
saw
there
a
man
which
had
not
on
a
wedding
and
he
saith
unto
how
camest
thou
in
hither
not
having
a
wedding
and
he
was
then
said
the
king
to
the
bind
him
hand
and
and
take
him
and
cast
into
outer
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
for
many
are
but
few
then
went
the
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
entangle
him
in
and
they
sent
out
unto
him
their
disciples
with
the
we
know
that
thou
art
and
teachest
the
way
of
god
in
neither
carest
thou
for
any
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
tell
us
what
thinkest
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
unto
or
but
jesus
perceived
their
and
why
tempt
ye
shew
me
the
tribute
and
they
brought
unto
him
a
and
he
saith
unto
whose
this
image
and
they
say
unto
then
saith
he
unto
render
therefore
unto
caesar
the
things
which
are
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
when
they
had
heard
they
and
left
and
went
their
the
same
day
came
to
him
the
which
say
that
there
is
no
and
asked
moses
if
a
man
having
no
his
brother
shall
marry
his
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
now
there
were
with
us
seven
and
the
when
he
had
married
a
having
no
left
his
wife
unto
his
likewise
the
second
and
the
unto
the
and
last
of
all
the
woman
died
therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
the
for
they
all
had
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
ye
do
not
knowing
the
nor
the
power
of
for
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
nor
are
given
in
but
are
as
the
angels
of
god
in
but
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
i
am
the
god
of
and
the
god
of
and
the
god
of
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
but
of
the
and
when
the
multitude
heard
they
were
astonished
at
his
but
when
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
he
had
put
the
sadducees
to
they
were
gathered
then
one
of
a
asked
a
tempting
and
which
the
great
commandment
in
the
jesus
said
unto
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
this
is
the
first
and
great
and
the
second
like
unto
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
on
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
while
the
pharisees
were
gathered
jesus
asked
what
think
ye
of
whose
son
is
they
say
unto
of
he
saith
unto
how
then
doth
david
in
spirit
call
him
the
lord
said
unto
my
sit
thou
on
my
right
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
if
david
then
call
him
how
is
he
his
and
no
man
was
able
to
answer
him
a
neither
durst
any
from
that
day
forth
ask
him
any
more
chapter
then
spake
jesus
to
the
and
to
his
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
sit
in
all
therefore
whatsoever
they
bid
you
observe
and
but
do
not
ye
after
their
for
they
and
do
for
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
and
lay
on
but
they
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
but
all
their
works
they
do
for
to
be
seen
of
they
make
broad
their
and
enlarge
the
borders
of
their
and
love
the
uppermost
rooms
at

the
chief
seats

he
that
is
greatest
among
you
shall
be
your
and
whosoever
shall
exalt
himself
shall
be
and
he
that
shall
humble
himself

but
woe
unto

receive
the
greater
woe

when
he
is
ye
make
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell

by
the
gold
of

ought
ye
to
have

i
say
unto
there

here
one
stone
upon

mount
of
the
disciples
came
unto
him
tell
when

these
things

sign
of
thy
and
of
the
end

jesus
answered
and
said
unto

heed
that
no
man

shall
deceive
and
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of

come
to
but
the
end
is
not
for

in
divers
all
these

shall
they
deliver
you
up
to

ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
nations
for

and
many
false
prophets

tribulation
of
those
days

what
hour
your
lord
doth

know
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
in
what
watch
the
thief
would
he
would
have
and
would
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
therefore
be
ye
also
for
in
such
an
hour
as
ye
think
not
the
son
of
man
who
then
is
a
faithful
and
wise
whom
his
lord
hath
made
ruler
over
his
to
give
them
meat
in
due
blessed
that
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
verily
i
say
unto
that
he
shall
make
him
ruler
over
all
his
but
and
if
that
evil
servant
shall
say
in
his
my
lord
delayeth
his
and
shall
begin
to
smite
and
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
the
lord
of
that
servant
shall
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
and
in
an
hour
that
he
is
not
aware
and
shall
cut
him
and
appoint
his
portion
with
the
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
chapter
then
shall
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
likened
unto
ten
which
took
their
and
went
forth
to
meet
the
and
five
of
them
were
and
five
they
that
foolish
took
their
and
took
no
oil
with
but
the
wise
took
oil
in
their
vessels
with
their
while
the
bridegroom
they
all
slumbered
and
and
at
midnight
there
was
a
cry
the
bridegroom
go
ye
out
to
meet
then
all
those
virgins
and
trimmed
their
and
the
foolish
said
unto
the
give
us
of
your
for
our
lamps
are
gone
but
the
wise
lest
there
be
not
enough
for
us
and
but
go
ye
rather
to
them
that
and
buy
for
and
while
they
went
to
the
bridegroom
and
they
that
were
ready
went
in
with
him
to
the
and
the
door
was
afterward
came
also

he
answered
and
verily
i
say
unto
i
know
you
watch
for
ye
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
wherein
the
son
of
man
for
kingdom
of
heaven
as
a
man
travelling
into
a
far
called
his
own
and
delivered
unto
them
his
and
unto
one
he
gave
five
to
another
and
to
another
to
every
man
according
to
his
several
and
straightway
took
his
then
he
that
had
received
the
five
talents
went
and
traded
with
the
and
made
other
five
and
likewise
he
that
he
also
gained
other
but
he
that
had
received
one
went
and
digged
in
the
and
hid
his
after
a
long
time
the
lord
of
those
servants
and
reckoneth
with
and
so
he
that
had
received
five
talents
came
and
brought
other
five
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
five
i
have
gained
beside
them
five
talents
his
lord
said
unto
well
good
and
faithful
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
i
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy

also
that
had
received
two
talents
came
and
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
two

have
gained
two
other
talents
beside
his
lord
said
unto

thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
i
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
then
he
which
had
received
the
one
talent
came
and
i
knew
thee
that
thou
art
an
hard
reaping
where
thou
hast
not
and
gathering
where
thou
hast
not
and
i
was
and
went
and
hid
thy
talent
in
the
thou
hast
his
lord
answered
and
said
unto
wicked
and
slothful
thou
knewest
that
i
reap
where
i
sowed
and

consulted
that
they
might

they
not
on

feast
lest
there
be
an
uproar
among

in
in
the
house
of
simon
the
there
came
unto
him
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
very
precious
and
poured
it
on
his
as
he
sat
but
when
his
disciples
saw
they
had
to
what
purpose
this
for
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
and
given
to
the
when
jesus
understood
he
said
unto
why
trouble
ye
the
for
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
upon
for
ye
have
the
poor
always
with

me
ye
have
not
for
in
that
she
hath
poured
this
ointment
on
my

say
unto
wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
the
whole
shall
also
that
this
woman
hath
be
told
for
a
memorial
of

one
of
the
called
judas
went
unto
the
chief
and
said
what
will
ye
give
and
i
will
deliver
him
unto
and
they
covenanted
with
him
for
thirty
pieces
of
and
from
that
time
he
sought
opportunity
to
betray
now

first
of
the
unleavened
bread
the
disciples
came
to
saying
unto
where
wilt
thou
that
we
prepare
for
thee
to
eat
the
and
he
go
into
the
city
to
such
a
and
say
unto
the
master
my
time
is
at
i
will
keep
the
passover
at
thy
house
with
my
and
the
disciples
did
as
jesus
had
appointed
and
they
made
ready
the
now
when
the
even
was
he
sat
down
with
the
and
as
they
did
he
verily
i
say
unto
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
and
they
were
exceeding
and
began
every
one
of
them
to
say
unto
is
it
and
he
answered
and
he
that
dippeth
hand
with
me
in
the
the
same
shall
betray
the
son
of
man
goeth
as
it
is
written
of
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
is
it
had
been
good
for
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
then
which
betrayed
answered
and
is
it
he
said
unto
thou
hast
and
as
they
were
jesus
took
and
blessed
and
brake
and
gave
to
the
and
this
is
my
and
he
took
the
and
gave
and
gave
to

all
of
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of

i
say
unto
i
will
not
drink
henceforth
of
this
fruit
of
the
until
that
day
when

drink
it
new
with
you
in
my
and
when
they
had
sung
an
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
then
saith
jesus
unto
all

shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
for
it
is
i
will
smite
the
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock

answered
and
said
unto
though

say
unto
that

shalt
deny
me
peter
said
unto
though
i
should
die
with

jesus
with
them
unto
a
place
called
and
saith

the
sit

while
i
go
and
pray
and
he
took
with
him
peter
and
the
two
sons
of
and
began
to
be
sorrowful
and
very
then
saith
he
unto
my
soul
is
exceeding
even
unto
tarry
ye
and
watch
with
and
he
went
a
little
and
fell
on
his
and
o
my
if
it
be
let
this
cup
pass
from
nevertheless
not
as
i
but
as
thou
and
he
cometh
unto
the
and
findeth
them
and
saith
unto
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
watch
and
that
ye
enter
not
into
the
spirit
indeed
but
the
flesh

went
away
again
the
second
and
o
my
if
this
cup
may
not
pass
away
from
except
i
drink
thy
will
be
and
he
came
and
found
them
asleep
for
their
eyes
were
and
he
left
and
went
away
and
prayed
the
third
saying
the
same
then
cometh
he
to
his
and
saith
unto
sleep
on
and
take
the
hour

at
and
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands

him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
from
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
now
he
that
betrayed
him
gave
them
a
whomsoever
i
shall
that
same
is
hold
him
and
forthwith
he
came
to
and
and
kissed
and
jesus
said
unto
wherefore
art
thou
then
came
and
laid
hands
on
and
took
one
of
them
which
were
with
jesus
stretched
out
and
drew
his
and
struck
a
servant
of
the
high
and
smote
off

the
thinkest
thou
that
i
cannot
now
pray
to
my
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions

for
to
take
i
sat
daily
with
you
teaching
in
the
and
ye
laid
no
hold
on
but
all
this
was
that
the
scriptures
of
the
prophets
might
be
then
all
the
disciples
forsook
and
and
they
that
had
laid
hold
on

and
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
and
it

from
the
sixth
hour
there
was
darkness
over

about
the

hour
jesus
cried
with
a
loud

forsaken
some
of
them
that

a
and
gave
him
to

let
let

again
with
a
loud
yielded
up
the
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
and
the
earth
did
and
the
rocks
and
the
graves
were
and
many
bodies
of
the
saints
which
slept
and
came
out
of
the
graves
after
his
and
went
into
the
holy
and
appeared
unto
now
when
the
and
they
that
were
with
watching
saw
the
and
those
things
that
were
they
feared
truly
this
was
the
son
of
and
many
women
were
there
beholding
afar
which
followed
jesus
from
ministering
unto
among
which
was
mary
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
and
the
mother
of
when
the
even
was
there
came
a
rich
man
of
named
who
also
himself
was
he
went
to
and
begged
the
body
of
then
pilate
commanded
the
body
to
be
and
when
joseph
had
taken
the
he
wrapped
it
in
a
clean
linen
and
laid
it
in
his
own
new
which
he
had
hewn
out
in
the
and
he
rolled
a
great
stone
to
the
door
of
the
and
and
there
was
mary
and
the
other
sitting
over
against
the
now
the
next
that
followed
the
day
of
the
the
chief

and
pharisees
came
together
unto
we
remember
that
that
deceiver
while
he
was
yet
after
three
days
i
will
rise
command
therefore
that
the
sepulchre
be
made
sure
until
the
third
lest
his
disciples
come
by
and
steal
him
and
say
unto
the
he
is
risen
from
the
so
the
last
error
shall
be
worse
than
the
pilate
said
unto
ye
have
a
go
your
make
as
sure
as
ye
so
they
and
made
the
sepulchre
sealing

of
the
as
it
began
to

toward
the
first
of
the

was
a
great
for
the

of
the
lord
descended
from

came
and
rolled
back
the
stone
from
the
and
sat
upon
his
countenance
was
like
and
his
raiment
white
as
and
for
fear
of
him
the
keepers
did
and
became
as
dead
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
fear
not
for
i
know
that
ye
seek
which
was
he
is
not
for
he
is
as
he
see
the
place
where
the
lord
and
go
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
is
risen
from
the
he
goeth
before
you
into
there
shall
ye
see
i
have
told
and
they
departed
quickly
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
great
and
did
run
to
bring
his
disciples
and
as
they
went
to
tell
his
jesus
met
all
and
they
came
and
held
him
by
the
and
worshipped
then
said
jesus
unto

my
brethren
that
they
go
into
and
there
shall
they
see
now
when
they
were
some
of
the
watch
came
into
the

shewed
unto
the
chief

all
the
things
that

and
when
they
were
assembled
with
the

had
taken
they
gave
large
money
unto
the
say
his
disciples
came
by
and
stole
him
while
we
and
if
this
come
to
the
we
will
persuade
and
secure
so
they
took
the
and
did
as
they
were
and
this
saying
is
commonly
reported
among
the
jews
until
this
then
the
eleven
disciples
went
away
into
into
a
mountain
where
jesus
had
appointed
and
when
they
saw

worshipped
but
some

they
were
astonished
at

questioned
among
what
thing

when
they
were
come
out
of

entered
into

she
ministered
unto

at
when
the
sun
did
they
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
and
them
that
were
possessed
with
and
all
the
city
was
gathered
together
at
the
and
he
healed
many
that
were
sick
of
divers
and
cast
out
many
and
suffered
not
the
devils
to
because
they
knew
and
in
the
rising
up
a
great
while
before
he
went
and
departed
into
a
solitary
and
there
and
simon
and
they
that
were
with
him
followed
after
and
when
they
had
found
they
said
unto
all

for
and
he
said
unto
let
us
go
into
the
next
that
i
may
preach
there
for
therefore
came
i
and
he
preached
in
their
synagogues
throughout
all
and
cast
out
and
there
came
a
leper
to
beseeching
and
kneeling
down
to
and
saying
unto
if
thou
thou
canst
make
me
and
moved
with
put
forth
and
touched
and
saith
unto
i
be
thou
and
as
soon
as
he
had
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
and
he
was
and
he
straitly
charged
and
forthwith
sent
him
and
saith
unto
see
thou
say
nothing
to
any
but
go
thy
shew
thyself
to
the
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing
those
things
which
moses
for
a
testimony
unto
but
he
went
and
began
to
publish
and
to
blaze
abroad
the
insomuch
that
jesus
could
no
more
openly
enter
into
the
but
was
without
in
desert
and
they
came
to
him
from
every
chapter
and
again
he
entered
into
capernaum
after
and
it
was
noised
that
he
was
in
the
and
straightway
many
were
gathered
insomuch
that
there
was
no
room
to
receive
not
so
much
as
about
the
and
he
preached
the
word
unto
and
they
come
unto
bringing
one
sick
of
the
which
was
borne
of
and
when
they
could
not
come
nigh
unto
him
for
the
they
uncovered
the
roof
where
he
and
when
they
had
broken
they
let
down
the
bed
wherein
the
sick
of
the
palsy
when
jesus
saw
their
he
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
thy
sins
be
forgiven
but
there
were
certain
of
the
scribes
sitting
and
reasoning
in
their
why
doth
this
thus
speak
who
can
forgive
sins
but
god
and
immediately
when
jesus
perceived
in
his
spirit
that
they
so
reasoned
within
he
said
unto
why
reason
ye
these
things
in
your
whether
is
it
easier
to
say
to
the
sick
of
the
sins
be
forgiven
or
to
and
take
up
thy
and
but
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
saith
to
the
sick
of
the
i
say
unto
and
take
up
thy
and
go
thy
way
into
thine
and
immediately
he
took
up
the
and
went
forth
before
them
insomuch
that
they
were
all
and
glorified
we
never
saw
it
on
this
and
he
went
forth
again
by
the
sea
and
all
the
multitude
resorted
unto
and
he
taught
and
as
he
passed
he
saw
levi
the
of
alphaeus
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
and
said
unto
follow
and
he
arose
and
followed
and
it
came
to
as
jesus
sat
at
meat
in
his
many
publicans
and
sinners
sat
also
together
with
jesus
and
his
for
there
were
and
they
followed
and
when
the
scribes
and
pharisees
saw
him
eat
with
publicans
and
they
said
unto
his
how
is
it
that
he
eateth
and
drinketh
with
publicans
and
when
jesus
heard
he
saith
unto
they
that
are
whole
have
no
need
of
the
but
they
that
are
i
came
not
to
call
the
but
sinners
to
and
the
disciples
of
john
and
of
the
pharisees
used
to
and
they
come
and
say
unto
why
do
the
disciples
of
john
and
of
the
pharisees
but
thy
disciples
fast
and
jesus
said
unto
can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
as
long
as
they
have
the
bridegroom
with
they
cannot
but
the
days
will
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
away
from
and
then
shall
they
fast
in
those
no
man
also
seweth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
on
an
old
else
the
new
piece
that
filled
it
up
taketh
away
from
the
and
the
rent
is
made
and
no
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
else
the
new
wine
doth
burst
the
and
the
wine
is
and
the
bottles
will
be
but
new
wine
must
be
put
into
new
and
it
came
to
that
he
went
through
the
corn
fields
on
the
sabbath
and
his
disciples
as
they
to
pluck
the
ears
of
and
the
pharisees
said
unto
why
do
they
on
the
sabbath
day
that
which
is
not
and
he
said
unto
have
ye
never
read
what
david
when
he
had
and
was
an
and
they
that
were
with
how
he
went
into
the
house
of
god
in
the
days
of
abiathar
the
high
and
did
eat
the
which
is
not
lawful
to
eat
but
for
the
and
gave
also
to
them
which
were
with
and
he
said
unto
the
sabbath
was
made
for
and
not
man
for
the
therefore
the
son
of
man
is
lord
also
of
the
chapter
and
he
entered
again
into
the
and
there
was
a
man
there
which
had
a
withered
and
they
watched
whether
he
would
heal
him
on
the
sabbath
that
they
might
accuse
and
he
saith
unto
the
man
which
had
the
withered
stand
and
he
saith
unto
is
it
lawful
to
do
good
on
the
sabbath
or
to
do
to
save
or
to
but
they
held
their
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
on
them
with
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
he
saith
unto
the
stretch
forth
thine
and
he
stretched
and
his

came
then
his
brethren
and
his
standing
sent
unto
calling
and
the
multitude
sat
about
and
they
said
unto
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
without
seek
for
and
he
answered
who
is
my
or
my
and
he
looked
round
about
on
them
which
sat
about
and
behold
my
mother
and
my
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
the
same
is
my
and
my
and
chapter
and
he
began
again
to
teach
by
the
sea
and
there
was
gathered
unto
him
a
great
so
that
he
entered
into
a
and
sat
in
the
and
the
whole
multitude
was
by
the
sea
on
the
and
he
taught
them
many
things
by
and
said
unto
them
in
his
there
went
out
a
sower
to
and
it
came
to
as
he
some
fell
by
the
way
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
came
and
devoured
it
and
some
fell
on
stony
where
it
had
not
much
and
immediately
it
sprang
because
it
had
no
depth
of
but
when
the
sun
was
it
was
and
because
it
had
no
it
withered
and
some
fell
among
and
the
thorns
grew
and
choked
and
it
yielded
no
and
other
fell
on
good
and
did
yield
fruit
that
sprang
up
and
and
brought
some
and
some
and
some
an
and
he
said
unto
he
that
hath
ears
to
let
him
and
when
he
was
they
that
were
about
him
with
the
twelve
asked
of
him
the
and
he
said
unto
unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mystery
of
the
kingdom
of
but
unto
them
that
are
all
things
are
done
in
that
seeing
they
may
and
not
and
hearing
they
may
and
not
lest
at
any
time
they
should
be
and
sins
should
be
forgiven
and
he
said
unto
know
ye
not
this
and
how
then
will
ye
know
all
the
sower
soweth
the
and
these
are
they
by
the
way
where
the
word
is
but
when
they
have
satan
cometh
and
taketh
away
the
word
that
was
sown
in
their
and
these
are
they
likewise
which
are
sown
on
stony
when
they
have
heard
the
immediately
receive
it
with
and
have
no
root
in
and
so
endure
but
for
a
when
affliction
or
persecution
ariseth
for
the
immediately
they
are
and
these
are
they
which
are
sown
among
such
as
hear
the
and
the
cares
of
this
and
the
deceitfulness
of
and
the
lusts
of
other
things
entering
choke
the
and
it
becometh
and
these
are
they
which
are
sown
on
good
such
as
hear
the
and
receive
and
bring
forth
some
some
and
some
an
and
he
said
unto
is
a
candle
brought
to
be
put
under
a
or
under
a
and
not
to
be
set
on
a
for
there
is
nothing
which
shall
not
be
neither
was
any
thing
kept
but
that
it
should
come
if
any
man
have
ears
to
let
him
and
he
said
unto
take
heed
what
ye
with
what
measure
ye
it
shall
be
measured
to
and
unto
you
that
hear
shall
more
be
for
he
that
to
him
shall
be
and
he
that
hath
from
him
shall
be
taken
even
that
which
he
and
he
so
is
the
kingdom
of
as
if
a
man
should
cast
seed
into
the
and
should
and
rise
night
and
and
the
seed
should
spring
and
grow
he
knoweth
not
for
the
earth
bringeth
forth
fruit
of
first
the
then
the
after
that
the
full
corn
in
the
but
when
the
fruit
is
brought
immediately
he
putteth
in
the
because
the
harvest
is
and
he
whereunto
shall
we
liken
the
kingdom
of
or
with
what
comparison
shall
we
compare
like
a
grain
of
mustard
when
it
is
sown
in
the
is
less
than
all
the
seeds
that
be
in
the
but
when
it
is
it
groweth
and
becometh
greater
than
all
and
shooteth
out
great
so
that
the
fowls
of
the
air
may
lodge
under
the
shadow
of
and
with
many
such
parables
spake
he
the
word
unto
as
they
were
able
to
hear
but
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
and
when
they
were
he
expounded
all
things
to
his
and
the
same
when
the
even
was
he
saith
unto
let
us
pass
over
unto
the
other
and
when
they
had
sent
away
the
they
took
him
even
as
he
was
in
the
and
there
were
also
with
him
other
little
and
there
arose
a
great
storm
of
and
the
waves
beat
into
the
so
that
it
was
now
and
he
was
in
the
hinder
part
of
the
asleep
on
a
and
they
awake
and
say
unto
carest
thou
not
that
we
and
he
and
rebuked
the
and
said
unto
the
be
and
the
wind
and
there
was
a
great
and
he
said
unto
why
are
ye
so
how
is
it
that
ye
have
no
and
they
feared
and
said
one
to
what
manner
of
man
is
that
even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
chapter
and
they
came
over
unto
the
other
side
of
the
into
the
country
of
the
and
when
he
was
come
out
of
the
immediately
there
met
him
out
of
the
tombs
a
man
with
an
unclean
who
had
dwelling
among
the
and
no
man
could
bind
not
with
because
that
he
had
been
often
bound
with
fetters
and
and
the
chains
had
been
plucked
asunder
by
and
the
fetters
broken
in
neither
could
any
tame
and
night
and
he
was
in
the
and
in
the
and
cutting
himself
with
but
when
he
saw
jesus
afar
he
ran
and
worshipped
and
cried
with
a
loud
and
what
have
i
to
do
with
son
of
the
most
high
i
adjure
thee
by
that
thou
torment
me
for
he
said
unto
come
out
of
the
unclean
and
he
asked
what
thy
and
he
my
name
for
we
are
and
he
besought
him
much
that
he
would
not
send
them
away
out
of
the
now
there
was
there
nigh
unto
the
mountains
a
great
herd
of
swine
and
all
the
devils
besought
send
us
into
the
that
we
may
enter
into
and
forthwith
jesus
gave
them
and
the
unclean
spirits
went
and
entered
into
the
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the

about
two
and
were
choked
in
the
and
they
that
fed
the
swine
and

they
went
out
to

befell
to
him
that
was
possessed
with
the
and
concerning
the
and
they
began
to
pray
him
to
depart
out
of
their
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
he
that
had
been
possessed
with
the
devil
prayed
him
that
he
might
be
with
howbeit
jesus
suffered
him
but
saith
unto
go
home
to
thy
and
tell
them
how
great
things
the
lord
hath
done
for
and
hath
had
compassion
on
and
he
and
began
to
publish
in
decapolis
how
great
things
jesus
had
done
for
and
all
did
and
when
jesus
was
passed
over
again
by
ship
unto
the
other
much
people
gathered
unto
and
he
was
nigh
unto
the
there
cometh
one
of
the
rulers
of

when
he
saw

fell
at

and
besought
him

went
with
and
much
people
followed
and
thronged
and
a
certain
which
had
an
issue
of
blood

and
had
suffered
many
things
of

and
had
spent
all
that

and
was
nothing
but
rather
grew
when
she
had
heard
of

in
the
press
and
touched
his
for
she
if
i
may
touch
but
his
i
shall
be
and
straightway
the
fountain
of
her
blood
was
dried
and
she
felt
in
body
that
she
was
healed
of
that
and
immediately
knowing
in
himself
that
virtue
had
gone
out
of
turned
him
about
in
the
and
who
touched
my
and
his
disciples
said
unto
thou
seest
the
multitude
thronging
and
sayest
who
touched
and
he
looked
round
about
to
see
her
that
had
done
this
but
the
woman
fearing
and
knowing
what
was
done
in
came
and
fell
down
before
and
told
him
all
the
and
he
said
unto
thy
faith

made
thee
go
in
and
be
whole
of
thy
while
he
yet
there
came
from
the
ruler
of

thy
daughter

to
the
house
of
the
ruler
of

and
when
he
was

he
saith
unto
why

and
they
laughed
him
to
but
when
he
had
put
them
all
he
taketh
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
and
them
that
were
with
and
entereth
in
where

he
took
the
damsel
by

say
unto
and
straightway
the
damsel
and
for
she
was
the
of
twelve
and
they
were
astonished
with
a
great
and
he
charged
them
straitly
that
no
man
should
know
and
commanded
that
something
should
be
given
her
to
chapter
and
he
went
out
from

came
into
his
own
and
his
disciples
follow
and
when
the
sabbath
day
was
he
began
to
teach
in
the
and
many
hearing
were
from
whence
hath
this
these
and
what
wisdom
this
which
is
given
unto
that
even
such
mighty
works
are
wrought
by
his
is
not
this
the
the
son
of
the
brother
of
and
and
of
and
and
are
not
his
sisters
here
with
and
they
were
offended
at
but
jesus
said
unto
a
prophet
is
not
without
but
in
his
own
and
among
his
own
and
in
his
own
and
he
could
there
do
no
mighty
save
that
he
laid
his
hands
upon
a
few
sick
and
healed
and
he
marvelled
because
of
their
and
he
went
round
about
the
and
he
called
the
and
began
to
send
them
forth
by
two
and
and
gave
them
power
over
unclean
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
take
nothing
for
save
a
staff
no
no
no
money
in
but
shod
with
and
not
put
on
two
and
he
said
unto
in
what
place
soever
ye
enter
into
an
there
abide
till
ye
depart
from
that
and
whosoever
shall
not
receive
nor
hear
when
ye
depart
shake
off
the
dust
under
your
feet
for
a
testimony
against
verily
i
say
unto
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
sodom
and
gomorrha
in
the
day
of
than
for
that
and
they
went
and
preached
that
men
should
and
they
cast
out
many
and
anointed
with
oil
many
that
were
and
healed
and
king
herod
heard
his
name
was
spread
and
he
that
john
the
baptist
was
risen
from
the
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
others
that
it
is
and
others
that
it
is
a
or
as
one
of
the
but
when
herod
heard
he
it
is
whom
i
he
is
risen
from
the

herod
himself
had
sent
forth
and
laid
hold
upon

bound
him
in

for
his
brother
for
he
had
married

said
unto

herodias
had
a
quarrel
against

that
he
was
a
just

when
a

he
sware
unto

she
went
and
said
unto
her
what

she
the
head
of
john
the
and
she
came
in
straightway
with
haste
unto
the

i
will
that

the
king
was
exceeding
for
his
and
for
their
sakes
which
sat
with

would
not
reject
and
immediately
the
king
sent
an

commanded
his
head
to
be

he
went
and
beheaded
him
in
the
and
brought
his
head
in
a

gave
it
to
the
and
the
damsel
gave
it
to
her
and
when
his
disciples
heard
they
came
and
took
up
his
and
laid
it
in
a
and
the
apostles
gathered
themselves
together
unto
and
told
him
all
both
what
they
had
and
what
they
had
and
he
said
unto
come
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
desert
and
rest
a
for
there
were
many
coming
and
and
they
had
no
leisure
so
much
as
to
and
they
departed
into
a
desert
place
by
ship
and
the
people
saw
them
and
many
knew
and
ran
afoot
thither
out
of
all
and
outwent
and
came
together
unto
and
when
he
came
saw
much
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
because
they
were
as
sheep
not
having
a

he
began
to
teach
them
many
and
when
the
day
was
now
far
his
disciples
came
unto
and
this
is
a
desert
and
now
the
time
far
send
them
that
they
may
go
into
the
country
round
and
into
the
and
buy
themselves
for
they
have
nothing
to

answered
and
said
unto
give
ye
them
to
and
they
say
unto

unto
how

and
when
they

and
two
and
he
commanded
them
to
make
all
sit
down
by
companies
upon
the
green
and
they
sat
down
in
by
and
by
and
when
he
had
taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
he
looked
up
to
and
and
brake
the

gave
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
and
the
two
fishes
divided
he
among
them
and
they
did
all
and
were
and
they
took
up
twelve
baskets
full
of
the
and
of
the
and
they
that
did
eat
of
the
loaves
were
about
five
thousand
and
straightway
he
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
the
and
to
go
to
the
other
side
before
unto
while
he
sent
away
the
and
when
he
had
sent
them
he
departed
into
a
mountain
to
and
when
even
was
the
ship
was
in
the
midst
of
the
and
he
alone
on
the
and
he
saw
them
toiling
in
for
the
wind
was
contrary
unto
and
about
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
he
cometh
unto
walking
upon
the
and
would
have
passed
by
but
when
they
saw
him
walking
upon
the
they
supposed
it
had
been
a
and
cried
for
they
all
saw
and
were
and
immediately
he
talked
with
and
saith
unto
be
of
good
it
is
be
not
and
he
went
up
unto
them
into
the
and
the
wind
and
they
were
sore
amazed
in
themselves
beyond
and
for
they
considered
not
of
the
for
their
heart
was
and
when
they
had
passed
they
came
into
the
land
of
and
drew
to
the
and
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
straightway
they
knew
and
ran
through
that
whole
region
round
and
began
to
carry
about
in
beds
those
that
were
where
they
heard
he
and
whithersoever
he
into
or
or
they
laid
the
sick
in
the
and
besought
him
that
they
might
touch
if
it
were
but
the
border
of
his
and
as
many
as
touched
him
were
made
chapter
then
came
together
unto
him
the
and
certain
of
the
which
came
from
and
when
they
saw
some
of
his
disciples

and
scribes
asked
why

disciples
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
but
eat
bread
with
unwashen
he
answered
and
said
unto
well

esaias
prophesied
of
you
as
it
is
this
people

me
with
but
their
heart
is

the
commandment
of

and
and
many
other

your
which
ye
have
and
many
such
like
things
do
and
when
he
had
called
all
the
people
he
said
unto
hearken
unto
me
every
one
and
there
is
nothing
from
without
a
that
entering
into
him
can
defile
but
the
things
which
come
out
of
those
are
they
that
defile
the
if
any
man
have
ears
to
let
him
and
when
he
was
entered
into
the
house
from
the
his
disciples
asked
him
concerning
the
and
he
saith
unto
are
ye
so
without
understanding
do
ye
not
that
whatsoever
thing
from

from
thence
he
and
went
into
the
borders
of
tyre
and
and
entered
into
an
and
would
have
no
man
know
but
he
could
not
be
for
a
whose
young
daughter
had
an
unclean
heard
of
and
came
and
fell
at
his

woman

a
a
syrophenician
by
and
she
besought
him
that
he
would
cast
forth
the
devil
out
of
her
but
jesus
said
unto
let
the
children
first
be
for
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
and
to
cast
unto
the
and
she
answered
and
said
unto
yet
the
dogs
under
the
table

of
the
and
he
said
unto
for
this
saying
go

the
devil
is
gone
out
of
thy
and
when
she
was
come
to
her
she
found
the
devil
gone
and
her
daughter
laid
upon
the
and
departing
from
the
coasts
of
tyre
and
he
came
unto
the
sea
of
through
the
midst
of
the
coasts
of
and
they
bring
unto
him
one
that
was
and
had
an
impediment
in
his
and
they
beseech
him
to
put
his
hand
upon
and
he
took
him
aside
from
the
and
put
his
fingers
into
his
and
he
and
touched
his
and
looking
up
to
he
and
saith
unto
that
be
and
straightway
his
ears
were
and
the
string
of
his
tongue
was
and
he
spake
and
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
but
the
more
he
charged
so
much
the
more
a
great
deal
they
published
and
were
beyond
measure
he
hath
done
all
things
he
maketh
both
the
deaf
to
and
the
dumb
to
chapter
in
those
days
the
multitude
being
very
and
having
nothing
to
jesus
called
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
i
have
compassion
on
the
because
they
have
now
been
with
me
three
and
have
nothing
to
and
if
i
send
them
away
fasting
to
their
own
they
will
faint
by
the
for
divers
of
them
came
from
and
his
disciples
answered
from
whence
can
a
man
satisfy
these
with
bread
here
in
the
and
he
asked
how
many
loaves
have
and
they
and
he
commanded
the
people
to
sit
down
on
the
and
he
took
the
seven
and
gave
and
and
gave
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
and
they
did
set
before
the
and
they
had
a
few
small
and
he
and
commanded
to
set
them
also
before
so
they
did
and
were
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
that
was
left
seven
and
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
four
and
he
sent
them
and
straightway
he
entered
into
a
ship
with
his
and
came
into
the
parts
of
and
the
pharisees
came
and
began
to
question
with
seeking
of
him
a
sign
from
tempting
and
he
sighed
deeply
in
his
and
why
doth
this
generation
seek
after
a
verily
i
say
unto
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
this
and
he
left
and
entering
into
the
ship
again
departed
to
the
other
now
had
forgotten
to
take
neither
had
they
in
the
ship
with
them
more
than
one
and
he
charged
take
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
and
the
leaven
of
and
they
reasoned
among
because
we
have
no
and
when
jesus
knew
he
saith
unto
why
reason
because
ye
have
no
perceive
ye
not
neither
have
ye
your
heart
yet
having
see
ye
and
having
hear
ye
and
do
ye
not
when
i
brake
the
five
loaves
among
five
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
they
say
unto
and
when
the
seven
among
four
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
and
they
and
he
said
unto
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
and
he
cometh
to
and
they
bring
a
blind
man
unto
and
besought
him
to
touch
and
he
took
the
blind
man
by
the
and
led
him
out
of
the
and
when
he
had
spit
on
his
and
put
his
hands
upon
he
asked
him
if
he
saw
and
he
looked
and
i
see
men
as
after
that
he
put
hands
again
upon
his
and
made
him
look
and
he
was
and
saw
every
man
and
he
sent
him
away
to
his
neither
go
into
the
nor
tell
to
any
in
the
and
jesus
went
and
his
into
the
towns
of
caesarea
and
by
the
way
he
asked
his
saying
unto
whom
do
men
say
that
i
and
they
john
the
but
some
and
one
of
the
and
he
saith
unto
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
and
peter
answereth
and
saith
unto
thou
art
the
and
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
of
and
he
began
to
teach
that
the
son
of
man
must
suffer
many
and
be
rejected
of
the
and
the
chief
and
and
be
and
after
three
days
rise
and
he
spake
that
saying
and
peter
took
and
began
to
rebuke
but
when
he
had
turned
about
and
looked
on
his
he
rebuked
get
thee
behind
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
but
the
things
that
be
of
and
when
he
had
called
the
people
with
his
disciples
he
said
unto
whosoever
will
come
after
let
him
deny
and
take
up
his
and
follow
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
but
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
and
the
the
same
shall
save
for
what
shall
it
profit
a
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
and
lose
his
own
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
whosoever
therefore
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
in
this
adulterous
and
sinful
of
him
also
shall
the
son
of
man
be
when
he
cometh
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
the
holy
chapter
and
he
said
unto
verily
i
say
unto
that
there
be
some
of
them
that
stand
which
shall
not
taste
of
till
they
have
seen
the
kingdom
of
god
come
with
and
after
six
days
jesus
taketh
and
and
and
leadeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart
by
and
he
was
transfigured
before
and
his
raiment
became
exceeding
white
as
so
as
no
fuller
on
earth
can
white
and
there
appeared
unto
them
elias
with
and
they
were
talking
with
and
peter
answered
and
said
to
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
and
let
us
make
three
one
for
and
one
for
and
one
for
for
he
wist
not
what
to
for
they
were
sore
and
there
was
a
cloud
that
overshadowed
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
this
is
my
beloved
hear
and
when
they
had
looked
round
they
saw
no
man
any
save
jesus
only
with
and
as
they
came
down
from
the
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
things
they
had
till
the
son
of
man
were
risen
from
the
and
they
kept
that
saying
with
questioning
one
with
another
what
the
rising
from
the
dead
should
and
they
asked
why
say
the
scribes
that
elias
must
first
and
he
answered
and
told
elias
verily
cometh
and
restoreth
all
and
how
it
is
written
of
the
son
of
that
he
must
suffer
many
and
be
set
at
but
i
say
unto
that
elias
is
indeed
and
they
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
as
it
is
written
of
and
when
he
came
to
he
saw
a
great
multitude
about
and
the
scribes
questioning
with
and
straightway
all
the
when
they
beheld
were
greatly
and
running
to
saluted
and
he
asked
the
what
question
ye
with
and
one
of
the
multitude
answered
and
i
have
brought
unto
thee
my
which
hath
a
dumb
and
wheresoever
he
taketh
he
teareth
and
he
and
gnasheth
with
his
and
pineth
and
i
spake
to
thy
disciples
that
they
should
cast
him
and
they
could
he
answereth
and
o
faithless
how
long
shall
i
be
with
how
long
shall
i
suffer
bring
him
unto
and
they
brought
him
unto
and
when
he
saw
straightway
the
spirit
tare
and
he
fell
on
the
and
wallowed
and
he
asked
his
how
long
is
it
ago
since
this
came
unto
and
he
of
a
and
ofttimes
it
hath
cast
him
into
the
and
into
the
to
destroy
but
if
thou
canst
do
any
have
compassion
on
and
help
jesus
said
unto
if
thou
canst
all
things
possible
to
him
that
and
straightway
the
father
of
the
child
cried
and
said
with
i
help
thou
mine
when
jesus
saw
that
the
people
came
running
he
rebuked
the
foul
saying
unto
dumb
and
deaf
i
charge
come
out
of
and
enter
no
more
into
and
and
rent
him
and
came
out
of
and
he
was
as
one
insomuch
that
many
he
is
but
jesus
took
him
by
the
and
lifted
him
and
he
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
his
disciples
asked
him
why
could
not
we
cast
him
and
he
said
unto
this
kind
can
come
forth
by
but
by
prayer
and
and
they
departed
and
passed
through
and
he
would
not
that
any
man
should
know
for
he
taught
his
and
said
unto
the
son
of
man
is
delivered
into
the
hands
of
and
they
shall
kill
and
after
that
he
is
he
shall
rise
the
third
but
they
understood
not
that
and
were
afraid
to
ask
and
he
came
to
and
being
in
the
house
he
asked
what
was
it
that
ye
disputed
among
yourselves
by
the
but
they
held
their
for
by
the
way
they
had
disputed
among
who
the
and
he
sat
and
called
the
and
saith
unto
if
any
man
desire
to
be
shall
be
last
of
and
servant
of
and
he
took
a
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
and
when
he
had
taken
him
in
his
he
said
unto
whosoever
shall
receive
one
of
such
children
in
my
receiveth
and
whosoever
shall
receive
receiveth
not
but
him
that
sent
and
john
answered
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
and
he
followeth
not
and
we
forbad
because
he
followeth
not
but
jesus
forbid
him
for
there
is
no
man
which
shall
do
a
miracle
in
my
that
can
lightly
speak
evil
of
for
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
on
our
for
whosoever
shall
give
you
a
cup
of
water
to
drink
in
my
because
ye
belong
to
verily
i
say
unto
he
shall
not
lose
his
and
whosoever
shall
offend
one
of
little
ones
that
believe
in
it
is
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
and
he
were
cast
into
the
and
if
thy
hand
offend
cut
it
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
than
having
two
hands
to
go
into
into
the
fire
that
never
shall
be
where
their
worm
dieth
and
the
fire
is
not
and
if
thy
foot
offend
cut
it
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
halt
into
than
having
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
into
the
fire
that
never
shall
be
where
their
worm
dieth
and
the
fire
is
not
and
if
thine
eye
offend
pluck
it
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
with
one
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
where
their
worm
dieth
and
the
fire
is
not
for
every
one
shall
be
salted
with
and
every
sacrifice
shall
be
salted
with
salt
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
wherewith
will
ye
season
have
salt
in
and
have
peace
one
with
chapter
and
he
arose
from
and
cometh
into
the
coasts
of
judaea
by
the
farther
side
of
and
the
people
resort
unto
him
as
he
was
he
taught
them
and
the
pharisees
came
to
and
asked
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
tempting
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
what
did
moses
command
and
they
moses
suffered
to
write
a
bill
of
and
to
put
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
for
the
hardness
of
your
heart
he
wrote
you
this
but
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
god
made
them
male
and
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
and
cleave
to
his
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
so
then
they
are
no
more
but
one
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
let
not
man
put
and
in
the
house
his
disciples
asked
him
again
of
the
same
and
he
saith
unto
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
and
marry
committeth
adultery
against
and
if
a
woman
shall
put
away
her
and
be
married
to
she
committeth
and
they
brought
young
children
to
that
he
should
touch
and
disciples
rebuked
those
that
brought
but
when
jesus
saw
he
was
much
and
said
unto
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
and
forbid
them
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
verily
i
say
unto
whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
god
as
a
little
he
shall
not
enter
and
he
took
them
up
in
his
put
hands
upon
and
blessed
and
when
he
was
gone
forth
into
the
there
came
one
and
kneeled
to
and
asked
good
what
shall
i
do
that
i
may
inherit
eternal
and
jesus
said
unto
why
callest
thou
me
none
good
but
thou
knowest
the
do
not
commit
do
not
do
not
do
not
bear
false
defraud
honour
thy
father
and
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
all
these
have
i
observed
from
my
then
jesus
beholding
him
loved
and
said
unto
one
thing
thou
go
thy
sell
whatsoever
thou
and
give
to
the
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
and
take
up
the
and
follow
and
he
was
sad
at
that
and
went
away
for
he
had
great
and
jesus
looked
round
and
saith
unto
his
how
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
and
the
disciples
were
astonished
at
his
but
jesus
answereth
and
saith
unto
how
hard
is
it
for
them
that
trust
in
riches
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
and
they
were
astonished
out
of
saying
among
who
then
can
be
and
jesus
looking
upon
them
with
men
but
not
with
for
with
god
all
things
are
then
peter
began
to
say
unto
we
have
left
and
have
followed
and
jesus
answered
and
verily
i
say
unto
there
is
no
man
that
hath
left
or
or
or
or
or
or
or
for
my
and
the
but
he
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
now
in
this
and
and
and
and
and
with
and
in
the
world
to
come
eternal
but
many
first
shall
be
and
the
last
and
they
were
in
the
way
going
up
to
and
jesus
went
before
and
they
were
and
as
they
they
were
and
he
took
again
the
and
began
to
tell
them
what
things
should
happen
unto
we
go
up
to
and
the
son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
chief
and
unto
the
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
and
they
shall
mock
and
shall
scourge
and
shall
spit
upon
and
shall
kill
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
and
james
and
the
sons
of
come
unto
we
would
that
thou
shouldest
do
for
us
whatsoever
we
shall
and
he
said
unto
what
would
ye
that
i
should
do
for
they
said
unto
grant
unto
us
that
we
may
one
on
thy
right
and
the
other
on
thy
left
in
thy
but
jesus
said
unto
ye
know
not
what
ye
can
ye
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
drink
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
and
they
said
unto
we
and
jesus
said
unto
ye
shall
indeed
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
drink
and
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
withal
shall
ye
be
but
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
hand
is
not
mine
to
but
shall
be
given
to
for
whom
it
is
and
when
the
ten
heard
they
began
to
be
much
displeased
with
james
and
but
jesus
called
them
and
saith
unto
ye
know
that
they
which
are
accounted
to
rule
over
the
gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
and
their
great
ones
exercise
authority
upon
but
so
shall
it
not
be
among
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
shall
be
your
and
whosoever
of
you
will
be
the
shall
be
servant
of
for
even
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
but
to
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
and
they
came
to
and
as
he
went
out
of
jericho
with
his
disciples
and
a
great
number
of
blind
the
son
of
sat
by
the
highway
side
and
when
he
heard
that
it
was
jesus
of
he
began
to
cry
and
son
of
have
mercy
on
and
many
charged
him
that
he
should
hold
his
but
he
cried
the
more
a
great
son
of
have
mercy
on
and
jesus
stood
and
commanded
him
to
be
and
they
call
the
blind
saying
unto
be
of
good
he
calleth
and
casting
away
his
and
came
to
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
what
wilt
thou
that
i
should
do
unto
the
blind
man
said
unto
that
i
might
receive
my
and
jesus
said
unto
go
thy
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
and
immediately
he
received
his
and
followed
jesus
in
the
chapter
and
when
they
came
nigh
to
unto
bethphage
and
at
the
mount
of
he
sendeth
forth
two
of
his
and
saith
unto
go
your
way
into
the
village
over
against
and
as
soon
as
ye
be
entered
into
ye
shall
find
a
colt
whereon
never
man
loose
and
bring
and
if
any
man
say
unto
why
do
ye
say
ye
that
the
lord
hath
need
of
and
straightway
he
will
send
him
and
they
went
their
and
found
the
colt
tied
by
the
door
without
in
a
place
where
two
ways
and
they
loose
and
certain
of
them
that
stood
there
said
unto
what
do
loosing
the
and
they
said
unto
them
even
as
jesus
had
and
they
let
them
and
they
brought
the
colt
to
and
cast
their
garments
on
and
he
sat
upon
and
many
spread
their
garments
in
the
and
others
cut
down
branches
off
the
and
strawed
in
the
and
they
that
went
and
they
that
blessed
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
the
kingdom
of
our
father
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
hosanna
in
the
and
jesus
entered
into
and
into
the
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
upon
all
and
now
the
eventide
was
he
went
out
unto
bethany
with
the
and
on
the
when
they
were
come
from
he
was
and
seeing
a
fig
tree
afar
off
having
he
if
haply
he
might
find
any
thing
and
when
he
came
to
he
found
nothing
but
for
the
time
of
figs
was
not
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
no
man
eat
fruit
of
thee
hereafter
for
and
his
disciples
heard
and
they
come
to
and
jesus
went
into
the
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
and
would
not
suffer
that
any
man
should
carry
vessel
through
the
and
he
saying
unto
is
it
not
my
house
shall
be
called
of
all
nations
the
house
of
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
and
the
scribes
and
chief
priests
heard
and
sought
how
they
might
destroy
for
they
feared
because
all
the
people
was
astonished
at
his
and
when
even
was
he
went
out
of
the
and
in
the
as
they
passed
they
saw
the
fig
tree
dried
up
from
the
and
peter
calling
to
remembrance
saith
unto
the
fig
tree
which
thou
cursedst
is
withered
and
jesus
answering
saith
unto
have
faith
in
for
verily
i
say
unto
that
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
be
thou
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
and
shall
not
doubt
in
his
but
shall
believe
that
those
things
which
he
saith
shall
come
to
he
shall
have
whatsoever
he
therefore
i
say
unto
what
things
soever
ye
when
ye
believe
that
ye
receive
and
ye
shall
have
and
when
ye
stand
if
ye
have
ought
against
that
your
father
also
which
is
in
heaven
may
forgive
you
your
but
if
ye
do
not
neither
will
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
forgive
your
and
they
come
again
to
and
as
he
was
walking
in
the
there
come
to
him
the
chief
and
the
and
the
and
say
unto
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
to
do
these
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
i
will
also
ask
of
you
one
and
answer
and
i
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
the
baptism
of
was
from
or
of
answer
and
they
reasoned
with
if
we
shall
from
he
will
why
then
did
ye
not
believe
but
if
we
shall
of
they
feared
the
for
all
counted
that
he
was
a
prophet
and
they
answered
and
said
unto
we
cannot
and
jesus
answering
saith
unto
neither
do
i
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
chapter
and
he
began
to
speak
unto
them
by
a
man
planted
a
and
set
an
hedge
about
and
digged
place
the
and
built
a
and
let
it
out
to
and
went
into
a
far
and
at
the
season
he
sent
to
the
husbandmen
a
that
he
might
receive
from
the
husbandmen
of
the
fruit
of
the
and
they
caught
and
beat
and
sent
away
and
again
he
sent
unto
them
another
and
at
him
they
cast
and
wounded
in
the
and
sent
away
shamefully
and
again
he
sent
and
him
they
and
many
beating
and
killing
having
yet
therefore
one
his
he
sent
him
also
last
unto
they
will
reverence
my
but
those
husbandmen
said
among
this
is
the
let
us
kill
and
the
inheritance
shall
be
and
they
took
and
killed
and
cast
out
of
the
what
shall
therefore
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
he
will
come
and
destroy
the
and
will
give
the
vineyard
unto
and
have
ye
not
read
this
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
is
become
the
head
of
the
this
was
the
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
and
they
sought
to
lay
hold
on
but
feared
the
for
they
knew
that
he
had
spoken
the
parable
against
and
they
left
and
went
their
and
they
send
unto
him
certain
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
to
catch
him
in
and
when
they
were
they
say
unto
we
know
that
thou
art
and
carest
for
no
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
but
teachest
the
way
of
god
in
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
to
or
shall
we
or
shall
we
not
but
knowing
their
said
unto
why
tempt
ye
bring
me
a
that
i
may
see
and
they
brought
and
he
saith
unto
whose
this
image
and
and
they
said
unto
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
render
to
caesar
the
things
that
are
and
to
god
the
things
that
are
and
they
marvelled
at
then
come
unto
him
the
which
say
there
is
no
and
they
asked
moses
wrote
unto
if
a
brother
and
leave
wife
and
leave
no
that
his
brother
should
take
his
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
now
there
were
seven
and
the
first
took
a
and
dying
left
no
and
the
second
took
and
neither
left
he
any
and
the
third
and
the
seven
had
and
left
no
last
of
all
the
woman
died
in
the
resurrection
when
they
shall
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
for
the
seven
had
her
to
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
do
ye
not
therefore
because
ye
know
not
the
neither
the
power
of
for
when
they
shall
rise
from
the
they
neither
nor
are
given
in
but
are
as
the
angels
which
are
in
and
as
touching
the
that
they
have
ye
not
read
in
the
book
of
how
in
the
bush
god
spake
unto
i
the
god
of
and
the
god
of
and
the
god
of
he
is
not
the
god
of
the
but
the
god
of
the
ye
therefore
do
greatly
and
one
of
the
scribes
and
having
heard
them
reasoning
and
perceiving
that
he
had
answered
them
asked
which
is
the
first
commandment
of
and
jesus
answered
the
first
of
all
the
commandments
o
the
lord
our
god
is
one
and
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
this
the
first
and
the
second
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
there
is
none
other
commandment
greater
than
and
the
scribe
said
unto
thou
hast
said
the
for
there
is
one
and
there
is
none
other
but
and
to
love
him
with
all
the
and
with
all
the
and
with
all
the
and
with
all
the
and
to
love
neighbour
as
is
more
than
all
whole
burnt
offerings
and
and
when
jesus
saw
that
he
answered
he
said
unto
thou
art
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
and
no
man
after
that
durst
ask
him
and
jesus
answered
and
while
he
taught
in
the
how
say
the
scribes
that
christ
is
the
son
of
for
david
himself
said
by
the
holy
the
lord
said
to
my
sit
thou
on
my
right
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
david
therefore
himself
calleth
him
and
whence
is
he
his
and
the
common
people
heard
him
and
he
said
unto
them
in
his
beware
of
the
which
love
to
go
in
long
and
salutations
in
the
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
and
the
uppermost
rooms
at
which
devour
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
these
shall
receive
greater
and
jesus
sat
over
against
the
and
beheld
how
the
people
cast
money
into
the
and
many
that
were
rich
cast
in
and
there
came
a
certain
poor
and
she
threw
in
two
which
make
a
and
he
called
his
and
saith
unto
verily
i
say
unto
that
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
more
than
all
they
which
have
cast
into
the
for
all
did
cast
in
of
their
but
she
of
her
want
did
cast
in
all
that
she
all
her
chapter
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
one
of
his
disciples
saith
unto
see
what
manner
of
stones
and
what
buildings
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
seest
thou
these
great
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
that
shall
not
be
thrown
and
as
he
sat
upon
the
mount
of
olives
over
against
the
peter
and
james
and
john
and
andrew
asked
him
tell
when
shall
these
things
and
what
the
sign
when
all
these
things
shall
be
and
jesus
answering
them
began
to
take
heed
lest
any
deceive
for
many
shall
come
in
my
i
am
and
shall
deceive
and
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
be
ye
not
for
must
needs
but
the
end
not
for
nation
shall
rise
against
and
kingdom
against
and
there
shall
be
earthquakes
in
divers
and
there
shall
be
famines
and
these
the
beginnings
of
but
take
heed
to
for
they
shall
deliver
you
up
to
and
in
the
synagogues
ye
shall
be
and
ye
shall
be
brought
before
rulers
and
kings
for
my
for
a
testimony
against
and
the
gospel
must
first
be
published
among
all
but
when
they
shall
lead
and
deliver
you
take
no
thought
beforehand
what
ye
shall
neither
do
ye
but
whatsoever
shall
be
given
you
in
that
that
speak
for
it
is
not
ye
that
but
the
holy
now
the
brother
shall
betray
the
brother
to
and
the
father
the
and
children
shall
rise
up
against
and
shall
cause
them
to
be
put
to
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
for
my
but
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
the
same
shall
be
but
when
ye
shall
see
the
abomination
of
spoken
of
by
daniel
the
standing
where
it
ought
him
that
readeth
then
let
them
that
be
in
judaea
flee
to
the
and
let

and
in
the
evening
he
cometh
with
the
and
as
they
sat
and
did
jesus
verily
i
say
unto
one
of
you
which
eateth
with
me
shall
betray
and
they
began
to
be
and
to
say
unto
him
one
by
it
and
another
it
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
one
of
the
that
dippeth
with
me
in
the
the
son
of
man
indeed
as
it
is
written
of
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
is
good
were
it
for
that
man
if
he
had
never
been
and
as
they
did
jesus
took
and
and
brake
and
gave
to
and
this
is
my
and
he
took
the
and
when
he
had
given
he
gave
to
and
they
all
drank
of
and
he
said
unto
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
which
is
shed
for
verily
i
say
unto
i
will
drink
no
more
of
the
fruit
of
the
until
that
day
that
i
drink
it
new
in
the
kingdom
of
and
when
they
had
sung
an
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
and
jesus
saith
unto
all
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
for
it
is
i
will
smite
the
and
the
sheep
shall
be
but
after
that
i
am
i
will
go
before
you
into
but
peter
said
unto
although
all
shall
be
yet
not
and
jesus
saith
unto
verily
i
say
unto
that
this
in
this
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
me
but
he
spake
the
more
if
i
should
die
with
i
will
not
deny
thee
in
any
likewise
also
said
they
and
they
came
to
a
place
which
was
named
and
he
saith
to
his
sit
ye
while
i
shall
and
he
taketh
with
him
peter
and
james
and
and
began
to
be
sore
and
to
be
very
and
saith
unto
my
soul
is
exceeding
sorrowful
unto
tarry
ye
and
and
he
went
forward
a
and
fell
on
the
and
prayed
if
it
were
the
hour
might
pass
from
and
he
all
things
possible
unto
take
away
this
cup
from
nevertheless
not
what
i
but
what
thou
and
he
and
findeth
them
and
saith
unto
sleepest
couldest
not
thou
watch
one
watch
ye
and
lest
ye
enter
into
the
spirit
truly
but
the
flesh
and
again
he
went
and
and
spake
the
same
and
when
he
he
found
them
asleep
their
eyes
were
neither
wist
they
what
to
answer
and
he
cometh
the
third
and
saith
unto
sleep
on
and
take
it
is
the
hour
is
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of

us
he
that
betrayeth
me

at
and
while
he
yet
cometh
one
of
the
and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
and
he
that
betrayed
him
had
given
them
a
whomsoever

shall
that
same
is
take
and
lead
away
and
as
soon
as
he
was
he
goeth
straightway
to
and
and
kissed
and
they
laid
their
hands
on
and
took
and
one
of
them
that
stood
by
drew
a
and
smote
a
servant
of
the
high
and
cut
off
his
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
are

come
as
against
a

swords
and
staves
to
take

was
daily
with
you
in
the
temple
and
ye
took
me
but
the
scriptures
must
be
and
they
all
forsook
and
and
there
followed
him
a
certain
young
having
a
linen
cloth
cast
about
naked
and
the
young
men
laid
hold
on
and
he
left
the
linen
and
fled
from
them
and
they
led
jesus
away
to
the
high
and
with
him
were
assembled
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
the
and
peter
followed
him
afar
even
into
the
palace
of
the
high
and
he
sat
with
the
and
warmed
himself
at
the
and
the
chief
priests
and
all
the
council
sought
for
witness
against
jesus
to
put
him
to
and
found
for
many
bare
false
witness
against
but
their
witness
agreed
not
and
there
arose
and
bare
false
witness
against

this
temple
that

within
three
days
i
will
build

neither
so
did
their
witness
agree
and
the
high
priest
stood
up
in
the
and
asked
answerest
thou
what
it
these
witness
against
but
he
held
his
and
answered
again
the
high
priest
asked
and
said
unto

the
the
son
of
the
and
jesus
i
and
ye
shall
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of

coming
in
the
clouds
of
then
the
high
priest
rent
his
and
what
need
we
any
further
ye
have
heard
the
what
think
and
they
all
condemned
him
to
be
guilty
of
and
some
began
to
spit
on
and
to
cover
his
and
to
buffet
and
to
say
unto
and
the
servants
did
strike
him
with
the
palms
of
their
and
as
peter
was
beneath
in
the
there
cometh
one
of
the
maids
of
the
high
and
when
she

and
began
to
say
to
them

and
a
little
they
that

by
said
again
to

thy
speech
agreeth

he
began
to
curse
and
to
i

and
the
second
time
the
cock
and
peter

then
after
the

sat
on

went
and
preached
every

working
with
and
confirming
the
word
with
signs
the
gospel
according
to
saint
luke
chapter
forasmuch
as
many
have
taken
in
hand
to
set
forth
in
order
a
declaration
of
those
things
which
are
most
surely
believed
among
even
as
they
delivered
them
unto
which
from
the
beginning
were
and
ministers
of
the
it
seemed
good
to
me
having
had
perfect
understanding
of
all
things
from
the
very
to
write
unto
thee
in
most
excellent
that
thou
mightest
know
the
certainty
of
those
wherein
thou
hast
been
there
was
in
the
days
of
the
king
of
a
certain
priest
named
of
the
course
of
and
his
wife
of
the
daughters
of
and
her
name
and
they
were
both
righteous
before
walking
in
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
of
the
lord
and
they
had
no
because
that
elisabeth
was
and
they
both
were
well
stricken
in
and
it
came
to
that
while
he
executed
the
office
before
god
in
the
order
of
his
according
to
the
custom
of
the
his
lot
was
to
burn
incense
when
he
went
into
the
temple
of
the
and
the
whole
multitude
of
the
people
were
praying
without
at
the
time
of
and
there
appeared
unto
him
an
angel
of
the
lord
standing
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
of
and
when
zacharias
saw
he
was
and
fear
fell
upon
but
the
angel
said
unto
fear
for
thy
prayer
is
and
thy
wife
elisabeth
shall
bear
thee
a
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
and
thou
shalt
have
joy
and
and
many
shall
rejoice
at
his
for
he
shall
be
great
in
the
sight
of
the
and
shall
drink
neither
wine
nor
strong
and
he
shall
be
filled
with
the
holy
even
from
his
and
many
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
he
turn
to
the
lord
their
and
he
shall
go
before
him
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
and
the
disobedient
to
the
wisdom
of
the
to
make
ready
a
people
prepared
for
the
and
zacharias
said
unto
the
whereby
shall
i
know
for
i
am
an
old
and
my
wife
well
stricken
in
and
the
angel
answering
said
unto
i
am
that
stand
in
the
presence
of
and
am
sent
to
speak
unto
and
to
shew
thee
these
glad
thou
shalt
be
and
not
able
to
until
the
day
that
these
things
shall
be
because
thou
believest
not
my
which
shall
be
fulfilled
in
their
and
the
people
waited
for
and
marvelled
that
he
tarried
so
long
in
the
and
when
he
came
he
could
not
speak
unto
and
they
perceived
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
in
the
for
he
beckoned
unto
and
remained
and
it
came
to
as
soon
as
the
days
of
his
ministration
were
he
departed
to
his
own
and
after
those
days
his
wife
elisabeth
and
hid
herself
five
thus
hath
the
lord
dealt
with
me
in
the
days
wherein
he
looked
on
to
take
away
my
reproach
among
and
in
the
sixth
month
the
angel
gabriel
was
sent
from
god
unto
a
city
of
named
to
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
of
the
house
of

and
the
angel
came
in
unto
and
that
highly
the
lord
with
blessed
thou
among
and
when
she
saw
she
was
troubled
at
his
and
cast
in
her
mind
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should
and
the
angel
said
unto
fear
for
thou
hast
found
favour
with
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
and
bring
forth
a
and
shalt
call
his
name
he
shall
be
and
shall
be
called
the
son
of
the
and
the
lord
god
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
and
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
for
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
then
said
mary
unto
the
how
shall
this
seeing
i
know
not
a
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
holy
ghost
shall
come
upon
and
the
power
of
the
highest
shall
overshadow
therefore
also
that
holy
thing
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
son
of
thy
cousin
she
hath
also
conceived
a
son
in
her
old
and
this
is
the
sixth

with
who
was
called
for
with
god
nothing
shall
be
and
mary
behold
the
handmaid
of
the
be

unto
me
according
to
thy
and

in
those
and
went
into
the
hill
country
with
into
a
city
of
and
entered
into
the
house
of

saluted
and
it
came
to
when
elisabeth
heard
the
salutation
of
the
babe
leaped
in
her
and
elisabeth
was
filled
with
the
holy
and
she
spake
out
with
a
loud
and
blessed
thou
among
and
blessed
the
fruit
of
thy
and
whence
this
to
that
the
mother
of
my
lord
should
come
to
as
soon
as
the
voice
of
thy
salutation
sounded
in
mine
the
babe
leaped
in
my
womb
for

blessed
she
that
for
there
shall
be
a
performance
of
those
things
which
were
told
her
from
the
and
mary
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
and
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
god
my
for
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
from
henceforth
all
generations

call
me
for

done
to
me
great
and

and

of
him
through

up
for
to
and
there

said
unto

do
ye
that
which
is
not
lawful

answering
them
have
ye
not
read
so
much
as
what

knew
their
and
said
to
the
man

immediately
it
and
the
ruin
of
that
house
was
chapter
now
when
he
had
ended
all
his
sayings
in
the
audience
of
the
he
entered
into
and
a
certain
who
was
dear
unto
was
and
ready
to
and
when
he
heard
of
he
sent
unto
him
the
elders
of
the
beseeching
him
that
he
would
come
and
heal
his
and
when
they
came
to
they
besought
him
that
he
was
worthy
for
whom
he
should
do
for
he
loveth
our
and
he
hath
built
us
a
then
jesus
went
with
and
when
he
was
now
not
far
from
the
the
centurion
sent
friends
to
saying
unto
trouble
not
for
i
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
enter
under
my
wherefore
neither
thought
i
myself
worthy
to
come
unto
but
say
in
a
and
my
servant
shall
be
for
i
also
am
a
man
set
under
having
under
me
and
i
say
unto
and
he
and
to
and
he
and
to
my
do
and
he
doeth
when
jesus
heard
these
he
marvelled
at
and
turned
him
and
said
unto
the
people
that
followed
i
say
unto
i
have
not
found
so
great
not
in
and
they
that
were
returning
to
the
found
the
servant
whole
that
had
been
and
it
came
to
pass
the
day
that
he
went
into
a
city
called
and
many
of
his
disciples
went
with
and
much
now
when
he
came
nigh
to
the
gate
of
the
there
was
a
dead
man
carried
the
only
son
of
his
and
she
was
a
and
much
people
of
the
city
was
with
and
when
the
lord
saw
he
had
compassion
on
and
said
unto
weep
and
he
came
and
touched
the
and
they
that
bare
stood
and
he
young
i
say
unto
and
he
that
was
dead
sat
and
began
to
and
he
delivered
him
to
his
and
there
came
a
fear
on
and
they
glorified
that
a
great
prophet
is
risen
up
among
that
god
hath
visited
his
and
this
rumour
of
him
went
forth
throughout
all
and
throughout
all
the
region
round
and
the
disciples
of
john
shewed
him
of
all
these
and
john
calling
two
of
his
disciples
sent
to
art
thou
he
that
should
or
look
we
for
when
the
men
were
come
unto
they
john
baptist
hath
sent
us
unto
art
thou
he
that
should
or
look
we
for
and
in
that
same
hour
he
cured
many
of
infirmities
and
and
of
evil
and
unto
many
blind
he
gave
then
jesus
answering
said
unto
go
your
and
tell
john
what
things
ye
have
seen
and
how
that
the
blind
the
lame
the
lepers
are
the
deaf
the
dead
are
to
the
poor
the
gospel
is
and
blessed
is
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
and
when
the
messengers
of
john
were
he
began
to
speak
unto
the
people
concerning
what
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
for
to
a
reed
shaken
with
the
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
a
man
clothed
in
soft
they
which
are
gorgeously
and
live
are
in
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
a
i
say
unto
and
much
more
than
a
this
is
of
whom
it
is
i
send
my
messenger
before
thy
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
for
i
say
unto
among
those
that
are
born
of
women
there
is
not
a
greater
prophet
than
john
the
but
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
god
is
greater
than
and
all
the
people
that
heard
and
the
justified
being
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
but
the
pharisees
and
lawyers
rejected
the
counsel
of
god
against
being
not
baptized
of
and
the
lord
whereunto
then
shall
i
liken
the
men
of
this
and
to
what
are
they
they
are
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
and
calling
one
to
and
we
have
piped
unto
and
ye
have
not
we
have
mourned
to
and
ye
have
not
for
john
the
baptist
came
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
and
ye
he
hath
a
the
son
of
man
is
come
eating
and
and
ye
behold
a
gluttonous
and
a
a
friend
of
publicans
and
but
wisdom
is
justified
of
all
her
and
one
of
the
pharisees
desired
him
that
he
would
eat
with
and
he
went
into
the
and
sat
down
to
a
woman
in
the
which
was
a
when
she
knew
that
sat
at
meat
in
the
brought
an
alabaster
box
of
and
stood
at
his
feet
behind
and
began
to
wash
his
feet
with
and
did
wipe
with
the
hairs
of
her
and
kissed
his
and
anointed
with
the
now
when
the
pharisee
which
had
bidden
him
saw
he
spake
within
this
if
he
were
a
would
have
known
who
and
what
manner
of
woman
that
toucheth
for
she
is
a
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
i
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
and
he
say
there
was
a
certain
creditor
which
had
two
the
one
owed
five
hundred
and
the
other
and
when
they
had
nothing
to
he
frankly
forgave
them
tell
me
which
of
them
will
love
him
simon
answered
and
i
suppose
that
to
whom
he
forgave
and
he
said
unto
thou
hast
rightly
and
he
turned
to
the
and
said
unto
seest
thou
this
i
entered
into
thine
thou
gavest
me
no
water
for
my
but
she
hath
washed
my
feet
with
and
wiped
with
the
hairs
of
her
thou
gavest
me
no
but
this
woman
since
the
time
i
came
in
hath
not
ceased
to
kiss
my
my
head
with
oil
thou
didst
not
but
this
woman
hath
anointed
my
feet
with
wherefore
i
say
unto
her
which
are
are
for
she
loved
but
to
whom
little
is
loveth
and
he
said
unto
thy
sins
are
and
they
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
began
to
say
within
who
is
this
that
forgiveth
sins
and
he
said
to
the
thy
faith
hath
saved
go
in
chapter
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
throughout
every
city
and
preaching
and
shewing
the
glad
tidings
of
the
kingdom
of
and
the
twelve
with
and
certain
which

and
many
which
ministered
unto
him
of
their
and
when
much

were
gathered
and
were
come
to
him
out
of
every
he
spake
by
a
a
sower
went
out
to
sow
his
and
as
he
some
fell
by
the
way
and
it
was
trodden
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
devoured
and
some
fell
upon
a
and
as
soon
as
it
was
sprung
it
withered
because
it
lacked
and
some
fell
among
and
the
thorns
sprang
up
with
and
choked
and
other
fell
on
good
and
sprang
and
bare

an
and
when
he
had
said
these
he
he
that
hath
ears
to
let
him
and
his
disciples
asked
what
might
this
parable
and
he
unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
but
to
others
in
that
seeing
they

now
the
parable
is
the
seed

the
word
of
those

they
that
then
cometh

not
be
made
neither
that

therefore
how

for
whosoever
to
him
shall
be
and
whosoever

from
him
shall
be
taken
even

which
he
seemeth
to

taken
up
of
fragments
that
remained
to
them
twelve
and
it
came
to
as
he
was
alone
his
disciples
were
with
and
he
asked
whom
say
the
people
that
i
they
answering
john
the
but
some
and
others
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
is
risen
he
said
unto
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
peter
answering
the
christ
of
and
he
straitly
charged
and
commanded
to
tell
no
man
that
the
son
of
man
must
suffer
many
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
and
be
and
be
raised
the
third
and
he
said
to
if
any
will
come
after
let
him
deny
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
but
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
the
same
shall
save
for
what
is
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
and
lose
or
be
cast
for
whosoever
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
of
him
shall
the
son
of
man
be
when
he
shall
come
in
his
own
and
and
of
the
holy
but
i
tell
you
of
a
there
be
some
standing
which
shall
not
taste
of
till
they
see
the
kingdom
of
and
it
came
to
pass
about
an
eight
days
after
these
he
took
peter
and
john
and
and
went
up
into
a
mountain
to
and
as
he
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
and
his
raiment
white
there
talked
with
him
two
which
were
moses
and
who
appeared
in
and
spake
of
his
decease
which
he
should
accomplish
at
but
peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
were
heavy
with
and
when
they
were
they
saw
his
and
the
two
men
that
stood
with
and
it
came
to
as
they
departed
from
peter
said
unto
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
and
let
us
make
three
one
for
and
one
for
and
one
for
not
knowing
what
he
while
he
thus
there
came
a
and
overshadowed
and
they
feared
as
they
entered
into
the
and
there
came
a
voice
out
of
the
this
is
my
beloved
hear
and
when
the
voice
was
jesus
was
found
and
they
kept
and
told
no
man
in
those
days
any
of
those
things
which
they
had
and
it
came
to
that
on
the
next
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
much
people
met
a
man
of
the
company
cried
i
beseech
look
upon
my
for
he
is
mine
only
a
spirit
taketh
and
he
suddenly
crieth
and
it
teareth
him
that
he
foameth
and
bruising
him
hardly
departeth
from
and
i
besought
thy
disciples
to
cast
him
and
they
could
and
jesus
answering
o
faithless
and
perverse
how
long
shall
i
be
with
and
suffer
bring
thy
son
and
as
he
was
yet
a
the
devil
threw
him
and
tare
and
jesus
rebuked
the
unclean
and
healed
the
and
delivered
him
again
to
his
and
they
were
all
amazed
at
the
mighty
power
of
but
while
they
wondered
every
one
at
all
things
which
jesus
he
said
unto
his
let
these
sayings
sink
down
into
your
for
the
son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
but
they
understood
not
this
and
it
was
hid
from
that
they
perceived
it
and
they
feared
to
ask
him
of
that
then
there
arose
a
reasoning
among
which
of
them
should
be
and
perceiving
the
thought
of
their
took
a
and
set
him
by
and
said
unto
whosoever
shall
receive
this
child
in
my
name
receiveth
and
whosoever
shall
receive
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
for
he
that
is
least
among
you
the
same
shall
be
and
john
answered
and
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
and
we
forbad
because
he
followeth
not
with
and
jesus
said
unto
forbid
for
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
for
and
it
came
to
when
the
time
was
come
that
he
should
be
received
he
stedfastly
set
his
face
to
go
to
and
sent
messengers
before
his
and
they
and
entered
into
a
village
of
the
to
make
ready
for
and
they
did
not
receive
because
his
face
was
as
though
he
would
go
to
and
when
his
disciples
james
and
john
saw
they
wilt
thou
that
we
command
fire
to
come
down
from
and
consume
even
as
elias
but
he
and
rebuked
and
ye
know
not
what
manner
of
spirit
ye
are
for
the
son
of
man
is
not
come
to
destroy
but
to
save
and
they
went
to
another
and
it
came
to
as
they
went
in
the
a
certain
said
unto
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
and
jesus
said
unto
foxes
have
and
birds
of
the
air
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
and
he
said
unto
follow
but
he
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
jesus
said
unto
let
the
dead
bury
their
but
go
thou
and
preach
the
kingdom
of
and
another
also
i
will
follow
but
let
me
first
go
bid
them
which
are
at
home
at
my
and
jesus
said
unto
no
having
put
his
hand
to
the
and
looking
is
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
chapter
after
these
things
the
lord
appointed
other
seventy
and
sent
them
two
and
two
before
his
face
into
every
city
and
whither
he
himself
would
therefore
said
he
unto
the
harvest
truly
but
the
labourers
pray
ye
therefore
the
lord
of
the
that
he
would
send
forth
labourers
into
his
go
your
i
send
you
forth
as
lambs
among
carry
neither
nor
nor
and
salute
no
man
by
the
and
into
whatsoever
house
ye
first
peace
to
this
and
if
the
son
of
peace
be
your
peace
shall
rest
upon
if
it
shall
turn
to
you
and
in
the
same
house
eating
and
drinking
such
things
as
they
for
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
go
not
from
house
to
and
into
whatsoever
city
ye
and
they
receive
eat
such
things
as
are
set
before
and
heal
the
sick
that
are
and
say
unto
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
nigh
unto
but
into
whatsoever
city
ye
and
they
receive
you
go
your
ways
out
into
the
streets
of
the
and
even
the
very
dust
of
your
which
cleaveth
on
we
do
wipe
off
against
notwithstanding
be
ye
sure
of
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
nigh
unto
but
i
say
unto
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
in
that
day
for
than
for
that
woe
unto
woe
unto
for
if
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
in
tyre
and
which
have
been
done
in
they
had
a
great
while
ago
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
but
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
tyre
and
sidon
at
the
than
for
and
which
art
exalted
to
shalt
be
thrust
down
to
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
and
the
seventy
returned
again
with
even
the
devils
are
subject
unto
us
through
thy
and
he
said
unto
i
beheld
satan
as
lightning
fall
from
i
give
unto
you
power
to
tread
on
serpents
and
and
over
all
the
power
of
the
and
nothing
shall
by
any
means
hurt
notwithstanding
in
this
rejoice
that
the
spirits
are
subject
unto
but
rather
because
your
names
are
written
in
in
that
hour
jesus
rejoiced
in
and
i
thank
o
lord
of
heaven
and
that
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
even
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
all
things
are
delivered
to
me
of
my
and
no
man
knoweth
who
the
son
but
the
and
who
the
father
but
the
and
to
whom
the
son
will
reveal
and
he
turned
him
unto
and
said
blessed
the
eyes
which
see
the
things
that
ye
for
i
tell
that
many
prophets
and
kings
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
and
have
not
seen
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
and
have
not
heard
a
certain
lawyer
stood
and
tempted
what
shall
i
do
to
inherit
eternal
he
said
unto
what
is
written
in
the
how
readest
and
he
answering
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
thy
neighbour
as
and
he
said
unto
thou
hast
answered
this
and
thou
shalt
but
willing
to
justify
said
unto
and
who
is
my
and
jesus
answering
a
certain
went
down
from
jerusalem
to
and
fell
among
which
stripped
him
of
his
and
wounded
and
leaving
half
and
by
chance
there
came
down
a
certain
priest
that
and
when
he
saw
he
passed
by
on
the
other
and
likewise
a
when
he
was
at
the
came
and
looked
and
passed
by
on
the
other
but
a
certain
as
he
came
where
he
and
when
he
saw
he
had
compassion
and
went
to
and
bound
up
his
pouring
in
oil
and
and
set
him
on
his
own
and
brought
him
to
an
and
took
care
of
and
on
the
morrow
when
he
he
took
out
two
and
gave
to
the
and
said
unto
take
care
of
and
whatsoever
thou
spendest
when
i
come
i
will
repay
which
now
of
these
thinkest
was
neighbour
unto
him
that
fell
among
the
and
he
he
that
shewed
mercy
on
then
said
jesus
unto
and
do
thou
now
it
came
to
as
they
that
he
entered
into
a
certain
and
a
certain
woman
named
martha
received
him
into
her
and
she
had
a
sister
called
which
also
sat
at
and
heard
his
but
martha
was
cumbered
about
much
and
came
to
and
dost
thou
not
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
but
one
thing
is
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
chapter
and
it
came
to
as
he
was
praying
in
a
certain
when
he
one
of
his
disciples
said
unto
teach
us
to
as
john
also
taught
his
and
he
said
unto
when
ye
our
father
which
art
in
hallowed
be
thy
thy
kingdom
thy
will
be
as
in
so
in
give
us
day
by
day
our
daily
and
forgive
us
our
for
we
also
forgive
every
one
that
is
indebted
to
and
lead
us
not
into
but
deliver
us
from
and
he
said
unto
which
of
you
shall
have
a
and
shall
go
unto
him
at
and
say
unto
lend
me
three
for
a
friend
of
mine
in
his
journey
is
come
to
and
i
have
nothing
to
set
before
and
he
from
within
shall
answer
and
trouble
me
the
door
is
now
and
my
children
are
with
me
in
i
cannot
rise
and
give
i
say
unto
though
he
will
not
rise
and
give
because
he
is
his
yet
because
of
his
importunity
he
will
rise
and
give
him
as
many
as
he
and
i
say
unto
and
it
shall
be
given
and
ye
shall
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
for
every
one
that
asketh
and
he
that
seeketh
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
if
a
son
shall
ask
bread
of
any
of
you
that
is
a
will
he
give
him
a
or
if
a
will
he
for
a
fish
give
him
a
or
if
he
shall
ask
an
will
he
offer
him
a
if
ye
being
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
how
much
more
shall
heavenly
father
give
the
holy
spirit
to
them
that
ask
and
he
was
casting
out
a
and
it
was
and
it
came
to
when
the
devil
was
gone
the
dumb
and
the
people
but
some
of
them
he
casteth
out
devils
through
beelzebub
the
chief
of
the
and
tempting
sought
of
him
a
sign
from
but
knowing
their
said
unto
every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
and
a
house
against
a
house
if
satan
also
be
divided
against
how
shall
his
kingdom
because
ye
say
that
i
cast
out
devils
through
and
if
i
by
beelzebub
cast
out
by
whom
do
your
sons
cast
therefore
shall
they
be
your
but
if
i
with
the
finger
of
god
cast
out
no
doubt
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
upon
when
a
strong
man
armed
keepeth
his
his
goods
are
in
but
when
a
stronger
than
he
shall
come
upon
and
overcome
he
taketh
from
him
all
his
armour
wherein
he
and
divideth
his
he
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
when
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
he
walketh
through
dry
seeking
and
finding
he
i
will
return
unto
my
house
whence
i
came
and
when
he
he
findeth
swept
and
then
goeth
and
taketh
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
and
they
enter
and
dwell
and
the
last
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
and
it
came
to
as
he
spake
these
a
certain
woman
of
the
company
lifted
up
her
and
said
unto
blessed
the
womb
that
bare
and
the
paps
which
thou
hast
but
he
yea
blessed
they
that
hear
the
word
of
and
keep
and
when
the
people
were
gathered
thick
he
began
to
this
is
an
evil
they
seek
a
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
but
the
sign
of
jonas
the
for
as
jonas
was
a
sign
unto
the
so
shall
also
the
son
of
man
be
to
this
the
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
the
men
of
this
and
condemn
for
she
came
from
the
utmost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
a
greater
than
solomon
the
men
of
nineve
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
and
shall
condemn
for
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
a
greater
than
jonas
no
when
he
hath
lighted
a
putteth
in
a
secret
neither
under
a
but
on
a
that
they
which
come
in
may
see
the
the
light
of
the
body
is
the
therefore
when
thine
eye
is
thy
whole
body
also
is
full
of
but
when
is
thy
body
also
full
of
take
heed
therefore
that
the
light
which
is
in
thee
be
not
if
thy
whole
body
therefore
full
of
having
no
part
the
whole
shall
be
full
of
as
when
the
bright
shining
of
a
candle
doth
give
thee
and
as
he
a
certain
pharisee
besought
him
to
dine
with
and
he
went
and
sat
down
to
and
when
the
pharisee
saw
he
marvelled
that
he
had
not
first
washed
before
and
the
lord
said
unto
now
do
ye
pharisees
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
the
but
your
inward
part
is
full
of
ravening
and
did
not
he
that
made
that
which
is
without
make
that
which
is
within
but
rather
give
alms
of
such
things
as
ye
all
things
are
clean
unto
but
woe
unto
for
ye
tithe
mint
and
rue
and
all
manner
of
and
pass
over
judgment
and
the
love
of
these
ought
ye
to
have
and
not
to
leave
the
other
woe
unto
for
ye
love
the
uppermost
seats
in
the
and
greetings
in
the
woe
unto
scribes
and
for
ye
are
as
graves
which
appear
and
the
men
that
walk
over
are
not
aware
then
answered
one
of
the
and
said
unto
thus
saying
thou
reproachest
us
and
he
woe
unto
you
for
ye
lade
men
with
burdens
grievous
to
be
and
ye
yourselves
touch
not
the
burdens
with
one
of
your
woe
unto
for
ye
build
the
sepulchres
of
the
and
your
fathers
killed
truly
ye
bear
witness
that
ye
allow
the
deeds
of
your
for
they
indeed
killed
and
ye
build
their
therefore
also
said
the
wisdom
of
i
will
send
them
prophets
and
and
of
them
they
shall
slay
and
that
the
blood
of
all
the
which
was
shed
from
the
foundation
of
the
may
be
required
of
this
from
the
blood
of
abel
unto
the
blood
of
which
perished
between
the
altar
and
the
verily
i
say
unto
it
shall
be
required
of
this
woe
unto
for
ye
have
taken
away
the
key
of
ye

not
in
and
them
that
were
entering
in
ye
and
as
he
said
these
things
unto
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
began
to
urge
and
to
provoke
him
to
speak
of
many
laying
wait
for
and
seeking
to
catch
something
out
of
his
that
they
might
accuse
chapter
in
the
mean
when
there
were
gathered
together
an
innumerable
multitude
of
insomuch
that
they
trode
one
upon
he
began
to
say
unto
his
disciples
first
of
beware
ye
of
the
leaven
of
the
which
is
for
there
is
nothing
that
shall
not
be
neither
that
shall
not
be
therefore
whatsoever
ye
have
spoken
in
darkness
shall
be
heard
in
the
and
that
which
ye
have
spoken
in
the
ear
in
closets
shall
be
proclaimed
upon
the
and
i
say
unto
you
my
be
not
afraid
of
them
that
kill
the
and
after
that
have
no
more
that
they
can
but
i
will
forewarn
you
whom
ye
shall
fear
which
after
he
hath
killed
hath
power
to
cast
into
i
say
unto
fear
are
not
five
sparrows
sold
for
two
and
not
one
of
them
is
forgotten
before
but
even
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
fear
not
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
also
i
say
unto
whosoever
shall
confess
me
before
him
shall
the
son
of
man
also
confess
before
the
angels
of
but
he
that
denieth
me
before
men
shall
be
denied
before
the
angels
of
and
whosoever
shall
speak
a
word
against
the
son
of
it
shall
be
forgiven
but
unto
him
that
blasphemeth
against
the
holy
ghost
it
shall
not
be
and
when
they
bring
you
unto
the
and
and
take
ye
no
thought
how
or
what
thing
ye
shall
or
what
ye
shall
for
the
holy
ghost
shall
teach
you
in
the
same
hour
what
ye
ought
to
and
one
of
the
company
said
unto
speak
to
my
that
he
divide
the
inheritance
with
and
he
said
unto
who
made
me
a
judge
or
a
divider
over
and
he
said
unto
take
and
beware
of
for
a
life
consisteth
not
in
the
abundance
of
the
things
which
he
and
he
spake
a
parable
unto
the
ground
of
a
certain
rich
man
brought
forth
and
he
thought
within
what
shall
i
because
i
have
no
room
where
to
bestow
my
and
he
this
will
i
i
will
pull
down
my
and
build
and
there
will
i
bestow
all
my
fruits
and
my
and
i
will
say
to
my
thou
hast
much
goods
laid
up
for
many
take
thine
be
but
god
said
unto
this
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
then
whose
shall
those
things
which
thou
hast
so
he
that
layeth
up
treasure
for
and
is
not
rich
toward
and
he
said
unto
his
therefore
i
say
unto
take
no
thought
for
your
what
ye
shall
neither
for
the
what
ye
shall
put
the
life
is
more
than
and
the
body
than
consider
the
for
they
neither
sow
nor
which
neither
have
storehouse
nor
and
god
feedeth
how
much
more
are
ye
better
than
the
and
which
of
you
with
taking
thought
can
add
to
his
stature
one
if
ye
then
be
not
able
to
do
that
thing
which
is
why
take
ye
thought
for
the
consider
the
lilies
how
they
they
toil
they
spin
and
yet
i
say
unto
that
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
if
then
god
so
clothe
the
which
is
to
day
in
the
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
how
much
more
he
o
ye
of
little
and
seek
not
ye
what
ye
shall
or
what
ye
shall
neither
be
ye
of
doubtful
for
all
these
things
do
the
nations
of
the
world
seek
and
your
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
but
rather
seek
ye
the
kingdom
of
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
fear
little
for
it
is
your
good
pleasure
to
give
you
the
sell
that
ye
and
give
provide
yourselves
bags
which
wax
not
a
treasure
in
the
heavens
that
faileth
where
no
thief
neither
moth
for
where
your
treasure
there
will
your
heart
be
let
your
loins
be
girded
and
lights
and
ye
yourselves
like
unto
men
that
wait
for
their
when
he
will
return
from
the
that
when
he
cometh
and
they
may
open
unto
him
blessed
those
whom
the
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
verily
i
say
unto
that
he
shall
gird
and
make
them
to
sit
down
to
and
will
come
forth
and
serve
and
if
he
shall
come
in
the
second
or
come
in
the
third
and
find
blessed
are
those
and
this
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
what
hour
the
thief
would
he
would
have
and
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
be
ye
therefore
ready
for
the
son
of
man
cometh
at
an
hour
when
ye
think
then
peter
said
unto
speakest
thou
this
parable
unto
or
even
to
and
the
lord
who
then
is

faithful
and
wise
whom
lord
shall
make
ruler
over
his
to

of
meat
in
due

that
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
of
a
truth
i
say
unto
that
he
will
make
him
ruler
over
all
that
he
but
and
if
that
servant
say
in
his
my
lord
delayeth
his
and
shall
begin
to
beat
the
menservants
and
and
to
eat
and
and
to
be
the
lord
of
that
servant
will
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
and
at
an
hour
when
he
is
not
and
will
cut
him
in
and
will
appoint
him
his
portion
with
the
and
that
which
knew
his
and
prepared
not
neither
did
according
to
his
shall
be
beaten
with
many
but
he
that
knew
and
did
commit
things
worthy
of
shall
be
beaten
with
few
for
unto
whomsoever
much
is
of
him
shall
be
much
and
to
whom
men
have
committed
of
him
they
will
ask
the
i
am
come
to
send
fire
on
the
and
what
will
if
it
be
already
but
i
have
a
baptism
to
be
baptized
and
how
am
i
straitened
till
it
be
suppose
ye
that
i
am
come
to
give
peace
on
i
tell
but
rather
for
from
henceforth
there
shall
be
five
in
one
house
three
against
and
two
against
the
father
shall
be
divided
against
the

daughter
against
the
the
mother
in
law
against
her
daughter
in
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
and
he
said
also
to
the
when
ye
see
a
cloud
rise
out
of
the
straightway

there
cometh
a
and
so
it
and
when

south
wind
ye
there
will
be
and
it
cometh
to
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
and
of
the
but
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
discern
this
and
why
even
of
yourselves
judge
ye
not
what
is
when
thou
goest
with
thine
adversary
to
the
thou
in
the
give
diligence
that
thou
mayest
be
delivered
from
lest
he
hale
thee
to
the
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
and
the
officer
cast
thee
into
i
tell
thou
shalt
not
depart
till
thou
hast
paid
the
very
last
chapter
there
were
present
at
that
season
some
that
told
him
of
the
whose
blood
pilate
had
mingled
with
their
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
suppose
ye
that
these
galilaeans
were
sinners
above
all
the
because
they
suffered
such
i
tell
except
ye
ye
shall
all
likewise
or
those
upon
whom
the
tower
in
siloam
and
slew
think
ye
that
they
were
sinners
above
all
men
that
dwelt
in
i
tell
except
ye
ye
shall
all
likewise
he
spake
also
this
a
certain
had
a
fig
tree
planted
in
his
and
he
came
and
sought
fruit
and
found
then
said
he
unto
the
dresser
of
his
these
three
years
i
come
seeking
fruit
on
this
fig
and
find
cut
it
why
cumbereth
it
the
and
he
answering
said
unto
let
it
alone
this
year
till
i
shall
dig
about
and
dung
and
if
it
bear
and
if
after
that
thou
shalt
cut
it
and
he
was
teaching
in
one
of
the
synagogues
on
the
there
was
a
woman
which
had
a
spirit
of
infirmity
eighteen
and
was
bowed
and
could
in
no
wise
lift
up
and
when
jesus
saw
he
called
to
and
said
unto
thou
art
loosed
from
thine
and
he
laid
hands
on
and
immediately
she
was
made
and
glorified
and
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
answered
with
because
that
jesus
had
healed
on
the
sabbath
and
said
unto
the
there
are
six
days
in
which
men
ought
to
in
them
therefore
come
and
be
and
not
on
the
sabbath
the
lord
then
answered
and
doth
not
each
one
of
you
on
the
sabbath
loose
his
ox
or
ass
from
the
and
lead
away
to
and
ought
not
this
being
a
daughter
of
whom
satan
hath
these
eighteen
be
loosed
from
this
bond
on
the
sabbath
and
when
he
had
said
these
all
his
adversaries
were
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
for
all
the
glorious
things
that
were
done
by
then
said
unto
what
is
the
kingdom
of
god
and
whereunto
shall
i
resemble
it
is
like
a
grain
of
mustard
which
a
man
and
cast
into
his
and
it
and
waxed
a
great
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
lodged
in
the
branches
of
and
again
he
whereunto
shall
i
liken
the
kingdom
of
it
is
like
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
till
the
whole
was
and
he
went
through
the
cities
and
and
journeying
toward
then
said
one
unto
are
there
few
that
be
and
he
said
unto
strive
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
for
i
say
unto
will
seek
to
enter
and
shall
not
be
when
once
the
master
of
the
house
is
risen
and
hath
shut
to
the
and
ye
begin
to
stand
and
to
knock
at
the
open
unto
and
he
shall
answer
and
say
unto
i
know
you
not
whence
ye
then
shall
ye
begin
to
we
have
eaten
and
drunk
in
thy
and
thou
hast
taught
in
our
but
he
shall
i
tell
i
know
you
not
whence
ye
depart
from
all
workers
of
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
when
ye
shall
see
and
and
and
all
the
in
the
kingdom
of
and
you
thrust
and
they
shall
come
from
the
and
the
and
from
the
and
the
and
shall
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
there
are
last
which
shall
be
and
there
are
first
which
shall
be
the
same
day
there
came
certain
of
the
saying
unto
get
thee
and
depart
for
herod
will
kill
and
he
said
unto
go
and
tell
that
i
cast
out
and
i
do
cures
to
day
and
to
and
the
third
i
shall
be
nevertheless
i
must
walk
to
and
to
and
the
for
it
cannot
be
that
a
prophet
perish
out
of
o
which
killest
the
and
stonest
them
that
are
sent
unto
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
as
a
hen
her
brood
under
and
ye
would
your
house
is
left
unto
you
and
verily
i
say
unto
ye
shall
not
see
until
come
when
ye
shall
blessed
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
chapter
and
it
came
to
as
he
went
into
the
house
of
one
of
the
chief
pharisees
to
eat
bread
on
the
sabbath
that
they
watched
there
was
a
certain
man
before
him
which
had
the
and
jesus
answering
spake
unto
the
lawyers
and
is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
and
they
held
their
and
he
took
and
healed
and
let
him
and
answered
which
of
you
shall
have
an
ass
or
an
ox
fallen
into
a
and
will
not
straightway
pull
him
out
on
the
sabbath
and
they
could
not
answer
him
again
to
these
and
he
put
forth
a
parable
to
those
which
were
when
he
marked
how
they
chose
out
the
chief
saying
unto
when
thou
art
bidden
of
any
to
a
sit
not
down
in
the
highest
lest
a
more
honourable
man
than
thou
be
bidden
of
and
he
that
bade
thee
and
him
come
and
say
to
give
this
man
and
thou
begin
with
shame
to
take
the
lowest
but
when
thou
art
go
and
sit
down
in
the
lowest
that
when
he
that
bade
thee
he
may
say
unto
go
up
then
shalt
thou
have
worship
in
the
presence
of
them
that
sit
at
meat
with
for
whosoever
exalteth
himself
shall
be
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
then
said
he
also
to
him
that
bade
when
thou
makest
a
dinner
or
a
call
not
thy
nor
thy
neither
thy
nor
rich
lest
they
also
bid
thee
and
a
recompence
be
made
but
when
thou
makest
a
call
the
the
the
the
and
thou
shalt
be
for
they
cannot
recompense
for
thou
shalt
be
recompensed
at
the
resurrection
of
the
and
when
one
of
them
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
heard
these
he
said
unto
blessed
he
that
shall
eat
bread
in
the
kingdom
of
then
said
he
unto
a
certain
man
made
a
great
and
bade
and
sent
his
servant
at
supper
time
to
say
to
them
that
were
for
all
things
are
now
and
they
all
with
one
began
to
make
the
first
said
unto
i
have
bought
a
piece
of
and
i
must
needs
go
and
see
i
pray
thee
have
me
and
another
i
have
bought
five
yoke
of
and
i
go
to
prove
i
pray
thee
have
me
and
another
i
have
married
a
and
therefore
i
cannot
so
that
servant
and
shewed
his
lord
these
then
the
master
of
the
house
being
angry
said
to
his
go
out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
and
bring
in
hither
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
servant
it
is
done
as
thou
hast
and
yet
there
is
and
the
lord
said
unto
the
go
out
into
the
highways
and
and
compel
to
come
that
my
house
may
be
for
i
say
unto
that
none
of
those
men
which
were
bidden
shall
taste
of
my
and
there
went
great
multitudes
with
and
he
and
said
unto
if
any
come
to
and
hate
not
his
and
and
and
and
and
and
his
own
life
he
cannot
be
my
and
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
and
come
after
cannot
be
my
for
which
of
intending
to
build
a
sitteth
not
down
and
counteth
the
whether
he
have
to
finish
lest
after
he
hath
laid
the
and
is
not
able
to
finish
all
that
behold

to
mock
this
man
began
to
and
was
not
able
to

what
going
to
make
war
against
another

not
down
and
consulteth
whether
he
be
able
with
ten
thousand
to
meet
him
that
cometh
against
him
with
twenty
or
while
the
other
is
yet
a
great
way
he
sendeth
an
and
desireth
conditions
of
so
whosoever
he
be
of
you
that
forsaketh
not
all
that
he
he
cannot
be
my
salt
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
wherewith

it
be
it
is
neither
fit
for
the
nor
yet
for
the
men
cast
it
he
that
hath
ears
to
let

then
drew
near
unto
him
all
the
publicans
and
sinners
for
to
hear
and
the
pharisees
and
scribes
this
man
receiveth
and
eateth
with
and
he
spake
this
parable
unto
what
man
of
having
an
hundred
if
he
lose
one
of
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
in
the
and
go
after
that
which
is
until
he
find

when
he
hath
found
he
layeth
on
his
and
when
he
cometh
he
calleth
together
friends
and
saying
unto
rejoice
with
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
i
say
unto
that
likewise
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
which
need
no
either

woman
having
ten
pieces
of
if
she
lose
one
doth
not
light
a
and

seek
diligently
till

and
when
she
hath
found
she
calleth
friends
and
neighbours
rejoice
with
for
i
have
found
the
piece
which
i
had
i
say
unto
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
and
he
a
certain
man
had
two
and
the
younger
of
them
said
to
give
me
the
portion
of
goods
that
falleth
and
he
divided
unto
them
and
not
many
days
after
the
younger
son
gathered
all
and
took
his
journey
into
a
far
and
there
wasted
his
substance
with
riotous
and
when
he
had
spent
there
arose
a
mighty
famine
in
that
and
he
began
to
be
in
and
he
went
and
joined
himself
to
a
citizen
of
that
and
he
sent
him
into
his
fields
to
feed
and
he
would
fain
have
filled
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
and
no
man
gave
unto
and
when
he
came
to
he
how
many
hired
servants
of
my
have
bread
enough
and
to
and
i
perish
with
i
will
arise
and
go
to
my
and
will
say
unto
i
have
sinned
against
and
before
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
make
me
as
one
of
thy
hired
and
he
and
came
to
his
but
when
he
was
yet
a
great
way
his
father
saw
and
had
and
and
fell
on
his
and
kissed
and
the
son
said
unto
i
have
sinned
against
and
in
thy
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
but
the
father
said
to
his
bring
forth
the
best
and
put
on
and
put
a
ring
on
his
and
shoes
on
and
bring
hither
the
fatted
and
kill
and
let
us
and
be
for
this
my
son
was
and
is
alive
he
was
and
is
and
they
began
to
be
now
his
elder
son
was
in
the
and
as
he
came
and
drew
nigh
to
the
he
heard
musick
and
and
he
called
one
of
the
and
asked
what
these
things
and
he
said
unto
thy
brother
is
and
thy
father
hath
killed
the
fatted
because
he
hath
received
him
safe
and
and
he
was
and
would
not
go
therefore
came
his
father
and
intreated
and
he
answering
said
to
these
many
years
do
i
serve
neither
transgressed
i
at
any
time
thy
and
yet
thou
never
gavest
me
a
that
i
might
make
merry
with
my
but
as
soon
as
this
thy
son
was
which
hath
devoured
thy
living
with
thou
hast
killed
for
him
the
fatted
and
he
said
unto
thou
art
ever
with
and
all
that
i
have
is
it
was
meet
that
we
should
make
and
be
for
this
thy
brother
was
and
is
alive
and
was
and
is
chapter
and
he
said
also
unto
his
there
was
a
certain
rich
which
had
a
and
the
same
was
accused
unto
him
that
he
had
wasted
his
and
he
called
and
said
unto
how
is
it
that
i
hear
this
of
give
an
account
of
thy
for
thou
mayest
be
no
longer
then
the
steward
said
within
what
shall
i
for
my
lord
taketh
away
from
me
the
i
cannot
to
beg
i
am
i
am
resolved
what
to
when
i
am
put
out
of
the
they
may
receive
me
into
their
so
he
called
every
one
of
his
debtors
and
said
unto
the
how
much
owest
thou
unto
my
and
he
an
hundred
measures
of
and
he
said
unto
take
thy
and
sit
down
and
write
then
said
he
to
and
how
much
owest
and
he
an
hundred
measures
of
and
he
said
unto
take
thy
and
write
and
the
lord
commended
the
unjust
because
he
had
done
for
the
children
of
this
world
are
in
their
generation
wiser
than
the
children
of
and
i
say
unto
make
to
yourselves
friends
of
the
mammon
of
when
ye
they
may
receive
you
into
everlasting
he
that
is
faithful
in
that
which
is
least
is
faithful
also
in
and
he
that
is
unjust
in
the
least
is
unjust
also
in
if
therefore
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
the
unrighteous
who
will
commit
to
your
trust
the
true
and
if
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
that
which
is
another
who
shall
give
you
that
which
is
your
no
servant
can
serve
two
for
either
he
will
hate
the
and
love
the
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
and
despise
the
ye
cannot
serve
god
and
and
the
pharisees
who
were
heard
all
these
and
they
derided
and
he
said
unto
ye
are
they
which
justify
yourselves
before
but
god
knoweth
your
for
that
which
is
highly
esteemed
among
men
is
abomination
in
the
sight
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
until
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
god
is
and
every
man
presseth
into
and
it
is
easier
for
heaven
and
earth
to
than
one
tittle
of
the
law
to
whosoever
putteth
away
his
and
marrieth
committeth
and
whosoever
marrieth
her
that
is
put
away
from
husband
committeth
there
was
a
certain
rich
which
was
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
and
fared
sumptuously
every
and
there
was
a
certain
beggar
named
which
was
laid
at
his
full
of
and
desiring
to
be
fed
with
the
crumbs
which
fell
from
the
rich
moreover
the
dogs
came
and
licked
his
and
it
came
to
that
the
beggar
and
was
carried
by
the
angels
into
the
rich
man
also
and
was
and
in
hell
he
lift
up
his
being
in
and
seeth
abraham
afar
and
lazarus
in
his
and
he
cried
and
father
have
mercy
on
and
send
that
he
may
dip
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
and
cool
my
for
i
am
tormented
in
this
but
abraham
remember
that
thou
in
thy
lifetime
receivedst
thy
good
and
likewise
lazarus
evil
but
now
he
is
and
thou
art
and
beside
all
between
us
and
you
there
is
a
great
gulf
so
that
they
which
would
pass
from
hence
to
you
neither
can
they
pass
to
that
from
then
he
i
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
send
him
to
my
for
i
have
five
that
he
may
testify
unto
lest
they
also
come
into
this
place
of
abraham
saith
unto
they
have
moses
and
the
let
them
hear
and
he
father
but
if
one
went
unto
them
from
the
they
will
and
he
said
unto
if
they
hear
not
moses
and
the
neither
will
they
be
though
one
rose
from
the
chapter
then
said
he
unto
the
it
is
impossible
but
that
offences
will
but
woe
through
whom
they
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
and
he
cast
into
the
than
that
he
should
offend
one
of
these
little
take
heed
to
if
thy
brother
trespass
against
rebuke
and
if
he
forgive
and
if
he
trespass
against
thee
seven
times
in
a
and
seven
times
in
a
day
turn
again
to
i
thou
shalt
forgive
and
the
apostles
said
unto
the
increase
our
and
the
lord
if
ye
had
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
ye
might
say
unto
this
sycamine
be
thou
plucked
up
by
the
and
be
thou
planted
in
the
and
it
should
obey
but
which
of
having
a
servant
plowing
or
feeding
will
say
unto
him
by
and
when
he
is
come
from
the
go
and
sit
down
to
and
will
not
rather
say
unto
make
ready
wherewith
i
may
and
gird
and
serve
till
i
have
eaten
and
and
afterward
thou
shalt
eat
and
doth
he
thank
that
servant
because
he
did
the
things
that
were
commanded
i
trow
so
likewise
when
ye
shall
have
done
all
those
things
which
are
commanded
we
are
unprofitable
we
have
done
that
which
was
our
duty
to
and
it
came
to
as
he
went
to
that
he
passed
through
the
midst
of
samaria
and
and
as
he
entered
into
a
certain
there
met
him
ten
men
that
were
which
stood
afar
and
they
lifted
up
and
have
mercy
on
and
when
he
saw
he
said
unto
go
shew
yourselves
unto
the
and
it
came
to
as
they
they
were
and
one
of
when
he
saw
that
he
was
turned
and
with
a
loud
voice
glorified
and
fell
down
on
face
at
his
giving
him
and
he
was
a
and
jesus
answering
were
there
not
ten
but
where
the
there
are
not
found
that
returned
to
give
glory
to
save
this
and
he
said
unto
go
thy
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
and
when
he
was
demanded
of
the
when
the
kingdom
of
god
should
he
answered
them
and
the
kingdom
of
god
cometh
not
with
neither
shall
they
lo
lo
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
and
he
said
unto
the
the
days
will
when
ye
shall
desire
to
see
one
of
the
days
of
the
son
of
and
ye
shall
not
see
and
they
shall
say
to
see
see
go
not
after
nor
follow
for
as
the
that
lighteneth
out
of
the
one
under
shineth
unto
the
other
under
so
shall
also
the
son
of
man
be
in
his
but
first
must
he
suffer
many
and
be
rejected
of
this
and
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
so
shall
it
be
also
in
the
days
of
the
son
of
they
did
they
they
married
they
were
given
in
until
the
day
that
noe
entered
into
the
and
the
flood
and
destroyed
them
likewise
also
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
they
did
they
they
they
they
they
but
the
same
day
that
lot
went
out
of
sodom
it
rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
and
destroyed
even
thus
shall
it
be
in
the
day
when
the
son
of
man
is
in
that
he
which
shall
be
upon
the
and
his
stuff
in
the
let
him
not
come
down
to
take
it
and
he
that
is
in
the
let
him
likewise
not
return
remember
whosoever
shall
seek
to
save
his
life
shall
lose
and
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
shall
preserve
i
tell
in
that
night
there
shall
be
two
in
one
the
one
shall
be
and
the
other
shall
be
two
shall
be
grinding
the
one
shall
be
and
the
other
two
shall
be
in
the
the
one
shall
be
and
the
other
and
they
answered
and
said
unto
and
he
said
unto
wheresoever
the
body
thither
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
chapter
and
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them
this
that
men
ought
always
to
and
not
to
there
was
in
a
city
a
which
feared
not
neither
regarded
and
there
was
a
widow
in
that
and
she
came
unto
avenge
me
of
mine
and
he
would
not
for
a
but
afterward
he
said
within
though
i
fear
not
nor
regard
yet
because
this
widow
troubleth
i
will
avenge
lest
by
her
continual
coming
she
weary
and
the
lord
hear
what
the
unjust
judge
and
shall
not
god
avenge
his
own
which
cry
day
and
night
unto
though
he
bear
long
with
i
tell
you
that
he
will
avenge
them
nevertheless
when
the
son
of
man
shall
he
find
faith
on
the
and
he
spake
this
parable
unto
certain
which
trusted
in
themselves
that
they
were
and
despised
two
men
went
up
into
the
temple
to
the
one
a
and
the
other
a
the
pharisee
stood
and
prayed
thus
with
i
thank
that
i
am
not
as
other
men
or
even
as
this
i
fast
twice
in
the
i
give
tithes
of
all
that
i
and
the
standing
afar
would
not
lift
up
so
much
as
eyes
unto
but
smote
upon
his
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
i
tell
this
man
went
down
to
his
house
justified
than
the
for
every
one
that
exalteth
himself
shall
be
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
and
they
brought
unto
him
also
that
he
would
touch
but
when
disciples
saw
they
rebuked
but
jesus
called
them
and
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
and
forbid
them
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
verily
i
say
unto
whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
god
as
a
little
child
shall
in
no
wise
enter
and
a
certain
ruler
asked
good
what
shall
i
do
to
inherit
eternal
and
jesus
said
unto
why
callest
thou
me
none
save
thou
knowest
the
do
not
commit
do
not
do
not
do
not
bear
false
honour
thy
father
and
thy
and
he
all
these
have
i
kept
from
my
youth
now
when
jesus
heard
these
he
said
unto
yet
lackest
thou
one
sell
all
that
thou
and
distribute
unto
the
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
and
follow
and
when
he
heard
he
was
very
for
he
was
very
and
when
jesus
saw
that
he
was
very
he
how
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
for
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
and
they
that
heard
who
then
can
be
and
he
the
things
which
are
impossible
with
men
are
possible
with
then
peter
we
have
left
and
followed
and
he
said
unto
verily
i
say
unto
there
is
no
man
that
hath
left
or
or
or
or
for
the
kingdom
of
who
shall
not
receive
manifold
more
in
this
present
and
in
the
world
to
come
life
then
he
took
the
and
said
unto
we
go
up
to
and
all
things
that
are
written
by
the
prophets
concerning
the
son
of
man
shall
be
for
he
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
and
shall
be
and
spitefully
and
spitted
and
they
shall
scourge
and
put
him
to
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
and
they
understood
none
of
these
and
this
saying
was
hid
from
neither
knew
they
the
things
which
were
and
it
came
to
that
as
he
was
come
nigh
unto
a
certain
blind
man
sat
by
the
way
side
and
hearing
the
multitude
pass
he
asked
what
it
and
they
told
that
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
and
he
son
of
have
mercy
on
and
they
which
went
before
rebuked
that
he
should
hold
his
but
he
cried
so
much
the
son
of
have
mercy
on
and
jesus
and
commanded
him
to
be
brought
unto
and
when
he
was
come
he
asked
what
wilt
thou
that
i
shall
do
unto
and
he
that
i
may
receive
my
and
jesus
said
unto
receive
thy
thy
faith
hath
saved
and
immediately
he
received
his
and
followed
glorifying
and
all
the
when
they
saw
gave
praise
unto
chapter
and
entered
and
passed
through
a
man
named
which
was
the
chief
among
the
and
he
was
and
he
sought
to
see
jesus
who
he
and
could
not
for
the
because
he
was
little
of
and
he
ran
and
climbed
up
into
a
sycomore
tree
to
see
for
he
was
to
pass
that
and
when
jesus
came
to
the
he
looked
and
saw
and
said
unto
make
and
come
for
to
day
i
must
abide
at
thy
and
he
made
and
came
and
received
him
and
when
they
saw
they
all
that
he
was
gone
to
be
guest
with
a
man
that
is
a
and
zacchaeus
and
said
unto
the
the
half
of
my
goods
i
give
to
the
and
if
i
have
taken
any
thing
from
any
man
by
false
i
restore
and
jesus
said
unto
this
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
forsomuch
as
he
also
is
a
son
of
for
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
and
as
they
heard
these
he
added
and
spake
a
because
he
was
nigh
to
and
because
they
thought
that
the
kingdom
of
god
should
immediately
he
said
a
certain
nobleman
went
into
a
far
country
to
receive
for
himself
a
and
to
and
he
called
his
ten
and
delivered
them
ten
and
said
unto
occupy
till
i
but
his
citizens
hated
and
sent
a
message
after
we
will
not
have
this
to
reign
over
and
it
came
to
that
when
he
was
having
received
the
then
he
commanded
these
servants
to
be
called
unto
to
whom
he
had
given
the
that
he
might
know
how
much
every
man

because
thou
art
an
austere
thou
takest

reapest
that
thou
didst
not

he
saith
unto
out
of
thine

judge
wicked
thou
knewest
that
i
was
an
austere
taking
up
that

not
wherefore
then
gavest
not
thou
my
money
into
the
that
at
my
coming
i
might
have
required
mine

he
said
unto
them
that
stood

give
to
him
that

ten
they
said
unto
he
hath
ten
for
i
say
unto
that
unto
every
one
which
hath
shall
be
and
from
him
that
hath
even
that
he
hath
shall
be
taken
away
from
but
those
mine
which
would
not
that
i
should
reign
over
bring
and
slay
before
and
when
he
had
thus
he
went
ascending
up
to
and
it
came
to
when
he
was
come
nigh
to
bethphage
and
at
the
mount
called
of
he
sent
two
of
his
go
ye
into
the
village
over
against
in
the
which
at
your
entering
ye
shall
find
a
colt
whereon
yet
never
man
loose
and
bring
and
if
any
man
ask
why
do
ye
loose
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
because
the
lord
hath
need
of
and
they
that
were
sent
went
their
and
found
even
as
he
had
said
unto
and
as
they
were
loosing
the
the
owners
thereof
said
unto
why
loose
ye
the
and
they
the
lord
hath
need
of
and
they
brought
him
to
and
they
cast
their
garments
upon
the
and
they
set
jesus
and
as
he
they
spread
their
clothes
in
the
and
when
he
was
come
even
now
at
the
descent
of
the
mount
of
the
whole
multitude
of
the
disciples
began
to
rejoice
and
praise
god
with
a
loud
voice
for
all
the
mighty
works
that
they
had
blessed
the
king
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
peace
in
and
glory
in
the
and
some
of
the
pharisees
from
among
the
multitude
said
unto
rebuke
thy
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
i
tell
you
if
these
should
hold
their
the
stones
would
immediately
cry
and
when
he
was
come
he
beheld
the
and
wept
over
if
thou
hadst
even
at
least
in
this
thy
the
things
unto
thy
but
now
they
are
hid
from
thine
for
the
days
shall
come
upon
that
thine
enemies
shall
cast
a
trench
about
and
compass
thee
and
keep
thee
in
on
every
and
shall
lay
thee
even
with
the
and
thy
children
within
and
they
shall
not
leave
in
thee
one
stone
upon
because
thou
knewest
not
the
time
of
thy
and
he
went
into
the
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
them
that
saying
unto
it
is
my
house
is
the
house
of
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
and
he
taught
daily
in
the
but
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
chief
of
the
people
sought
to
destroy
and
could
not
find
what
they
might
for
all
the
people
were
very
attentive
to
hear
chapter
and
it
came
to
on
one
of
those
as
he
taught
the
people
in
the
and
preached
the
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
upon
with
the
and
spake
unto
tell
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
or
who
is
he
that
gave
thee
this
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
i
will
also
ask
you
one
and
answer
the
baptism
of
was
it
from
or
of
and
they
reasoned
with
if
we
shall
from
he
will
why
then
believed
ye
him
but
and
if
we
of
all
the
people
will
stone
for
they
be
persuaded
that
john
was
a
and
they
that
they
could
not
tell
whence
and
jesus
said
unto
neither
tell
i
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
then
began
he
to
speak
to
the
people
this
a
certain
man
planted
a
and
let
it
forth
to
and
went
into
a
far
country
for
a
long
and
at
the
season
he
sent
a
servant
to
the
that
they
should
give
him
of
the
fruit
of
the
but
the
husbandmen
beat
and
sent
away
and
again
he
sent
another
and
they
beat
him
and
entreated
and
sent
away
and
again
he
sent
a
and
they
wounded
him
and
cast
then
said
the
lord
of
the
what
shall
i
i
will
send
my
beloved
it
may
be
they
will
reverence
when
they
see
but
when
the
husbandmen
saw
they
reasoned
among
this
is
the
let
us
kill
that
the
inheritance
may
be
so
they
cast
him
out
of
the
and
killed
what
therefore
shall
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
do
unto
he
shall
come
and
destroy
these
and
shall
give
the
vineyard
to
and
when
they
heard
they
god
and
he
beheld
and
what
is
this
then
that
is
the
stone
which
the
builders
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
whosoever
shall
fall
upon
that
stone
shall
be
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
it
will
grind
him
to
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
the
same
hour
sought
to
lay
hands
on
and
they
feared
the
for
they
perceived
that
he
had
spoken
this
parable
against
and
they
watched
and
sent
forth
which
should
feign
themselves
just
that
they
might
take
hold
of
his
that
so
they
might
deliver
him
unto
the
power
and
authority
of
the
and
they
asked
we
know
that
thou
sayest
and
teachest
neither
acceptest
thou
the
person
but
teachest
the
way
of
god
is
it
lawful
for
us
to
give
tribute
unto
or
but
he
perceived
their
and
said
unto
why
tempt
ye
shew
me
a
whose
image
and
superscription
hath
they
answered
and
and
he
said
unto
render
therefore
unto
caesar
the
things
which
be
and
unto
god
the
things
which
be
and
they
could
not
take
hold
of
his
words
before
the
and
they
marvelled
at
his
and
held
their
then
came
to
certain
of
the
which
deny
that
there
is
any
and
they
asked
moses
wrote
unto
if
any
brother
having
a
and
he
die
without
that
his
brother
should
take
his
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
there
were
therefore
seven
and
the
first
took
a
and
died
without
and
the
second
took
her
to
and
he
died
and
the
third
took
and
in
like
manner
the
seven
and
they
left
no
and
last
of
all
the
woman
died
therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
of
them
is
for
seven
had
her
to
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
the
children
of
this
world
and
are
given
in
but
they
which
shall
be
accounted
worthy
to
obtain
that
and
the
resurrection
from
the
neither
nor
are
given
in
neither
can
they
die
any
for
they
are
equal
unto
the
and
are
the
children
of
being
the
children
of
the
now
that
the
dead
are
even
moses
shewed
at
the
when
he
calleth
the
lord
the
god
of
and
the
god
of
and
the
god
of
for
he
is
not
a
god
of
the
but
of
the
for
all
live
unto
then
certain
of
the
scribes
answering
thou
hast
well
and
after
that
they
durst
not
ask
him
any
at
and
he
said
unto
how
say
they
that
christ
is
and
david
himself
saith
in
the
book
of
the
lord
said
unto
my
sit
thou
on
my
right
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
david
therefore
calleth
him
how
is
he
then
his
then
in
the
audience
of
all
the
people
he
said
unto
his
beware
of
the
which
desire
to
walk
in
long
and
love
greetings
in
the
and
the
highest
seats
in
the
and
the
chief
rooms
at
which
devour
and
for
a
shew
make
long
the
same
shall
receive
greater
chapter
and
he
looked
and
saw
the
rich
men
casting
their
gifts
into
the
and
he
saw
also
a
certain
poor
widow
casting
in
thither
two
and
he
of
a
truth
i
say
unto
that
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
in
more
than
they
for
all
these
have
of
their
abundance
cast
in
unto
the
offerings
of
but
she
of
her
penury
hath
cast
in
all
the
living
that
she
and
as
some
spake
of
the
how
it
was
adorned
with
goodly
stones
and
he
these
things
which
ye
the
days
will
in
the
which
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
that
shall
not
be
thrown
and
they
asked
but
when
shall
these
things
and
what
sign
there
when
these
things
shall
come
to
and
he
take
heed
that
ye
be
not
for
many
shall
come
in
my
i
am
and
the
time
draweth
go
ye
not
therefore
after
but
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
be
not
for
these
things
must
first
come
to
but
the
end
not
by
and
then
said
he
unto
nation
shall
rise
against
and
kingdom
against
and
great
earthquakes
shall
be
in
divers
and
and
and
fearful
sights
and
great
signs
shall
there
be
from
but
before
all
they
shall
lay
their
hands
on
and
persecute
delivering
up
to
the
and
into
being
brought
before
kings
and
rulers
for
my
and
it
shall
turn
to
you
for
a
settle
therefore
in
your
not
to
meditate
before
what
ye
shall
for
i
will
give
you
a
mouth
and
which
all
your
adversaries
shall
not
be
able
to
gainsay
nor
and
ye
shall
be
betrayed
both
by
and
and
and
and
of
you
shall
they
cause
to
be
put
to
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
for
my
but
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
your
head
in
your
patience
possess
ye
your
and
when
ye
shall
see
jerusalem
compassed
with
then
know
that
the
desolation
thereof
is
then
let
them
which
are
in
judaea
flee
to
the
and
let
them
which
are
in
the
midst
of
it
depart
and
let
not
them
that
are
in
the
countries
enter
for
these
be
the
days
of
that
all
things
which
are
written
may
be
but
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
and
to
them
that
give
in
those
for
there
shall
be
great
distress
in
the
and
wrath
upon
this
and
they
shall
fall
by
the
edge
of
the
and
shall
be
led
away
captive
into
all
and
jerusalem
shall
be
trodden
down
of
the
until
the
times
of
the
gentiles
be
and
there
shall
be
signs
in
the
and
in
the
and
in
the
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of
with
the
sea
and
the
waves
hearts
failing
them
for
and
for
looking
after
those
things
which
are
coming
on
the
for
the
powers
of
heaven
shall
be
and
then
shall
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
a
cloud
with
power
and
great
and
when
these
things
begin
to
come
to
then
look
and
lift
up
your
for
your
redemption
draweth
and
he
spake
to
them
a
behold
the
fig
and
all
the
when
they
now
shoot

see
and
know
of
your
own
selves
that
summer
is
now
nigh
at
so
likewise
when
ye
see
these
things
come
to
know
ye
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
nigh
at

i
say
unto
this
generation
shall
not
pass
till

and
earth
shall
pass
but
my
words
shall
not
pass

take
heed
to
lest
at
any
time
your
hearts
be
overcharged
with
and
and
cares
of
this
and
that
day
come
upon
you
for
as
a
snare
shall
it
come
on
all
them
that
dwell
on
the
face
of
the
whole
watch
ye
and
pray
that
ye
may
be
accounted
worthy
to
escape
all
these
things
that
shall
come
to
and
to
stand
before
the
son
of
and
in
the
day
time
he
was
teaching
in
the
and
at
night
he
went
and
abode
in
the
mount
that
is
called
of
and
all
the
people
came
early
in
the
morning
to
him
in
the
for
to
hear
chapter
now
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
drew
which
is
called
the
and
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
sought
how
they
might
kill
for
they
feared
the
then
entered
satan
into
judas
surnamed
being
of
the
number
of
the
and
he
went
his
and
communed
with
the
chief
priests
and
how
he
might
betray
him
unto
and
they
were
and
covenanted
to
give
him
and
he
and
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him
unto
them
in
the
absence
of
the
then
came
the
day
of
unleavened
when
the
passover
must
be
and
he
sent
peter
and
go
and
prepare
us
the
that
we
may
and
they
said
unto
where
wilt
thou
that
we
and
he
said
unto
when
ye
are
entered
into
the
there
shall
a
man
meet
bearing
a
pitcher
of
follow
him
into
the
house
where
he
entereth
and
ye
shall
say
unto
the
goodman
of
the
the
master
saith
unto
where
is
the
where
i
shall
eat
the
passover
with
my
and
he
shall
shew
you
a
large
upper
room
there
make
and
they
and
found
as
he
had
said
unto
and
they
made
ready
the
and
when
the
hour
was
he
sat
and
the
twelve
apostles
with
and
he
said
unto
with
desire
i
have
desired
to
eat
this
passover
with
you
before
i
for
i
say
unto
i
will
not
any
more
eat
until
it
be
fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
of
and
he
took
the
and
gave
and
take
and
divide
among
for
i
say
unto
i
will
not
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
until

he
took
and
gave
and

my
body
which
is
given
for
this
do
in
remembrance
of
likewise
also
the
cup
after
this

the
new
testament
in
my
which
is
shed
for
the
hand
of
him
that
betrayeth
me
with
me
on
the
and
truly
the
son
of
man
as
it
was
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
he
is
and
they
began
to
enquire
among
which
of
them
it
was
that
should
do
this
and
there
was
also
a
strife
among
which
of
them
should
be
accounted
the
and
he
said
unto
the
kings
of
the
gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
and
they
that
exercise
authority
upon
them
are
called
but
ye
not
but
he
that
is
greatest
among
let
him
be
as
the
and
he
that
is
as
he
that
doth
for
whether
he
that
sitteth
at
or
he
that
not
he
that
sitteth
at
but
i
am
among
you
as
he
that
ye
are
they
which
have
continued
with
me
in
my
and
i
appoint
unto
you
a
as
my
father
hath
appointed
unto
that
ye
may
eat
and
drink
at
my
table
in
my
and
sit
on
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
and
the
lord
satan
hath
desired
that
he
may
sift
as
but
i
have
prayed
for
that
thy
faith
fail
and
when
thou
art
strengthen
thy
and
he
said
unto
i
am
ready
to
go
with
both
into
and
to
and
he
i
tell
the
cock
shall
not
crow
this
before
that
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that
thou
knowest
and
he
said
unto
when
i
sent
you
without
and
and
lacked
ye
any
and
they
then
said
he
unto
but
he
that

a
let
him
take
and
likewise
and
he
that
hath
no
let
him
sell
his
and
buy
for
i
say
unto
that
this
that
is
written
must
yet
be
accomplished
in
and
he
was
reckoned
among
the
for
the
things
concerning
me
have
an
and
they
here
two
and
he
said
unto
it
is
and
he
came
and
as
he
was
to
the
mount
of
and
his
disciples
also
followed
and
when
he
was
at
the
he
said
unto
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
and
he
was
withdrawn
from
them
about
a
and
kneeled
and
if
thou
be
remove
this
cup
from
nevertheless
not
my
but
be
and
there
appeared
an
angel
unto
him
from
strengthening
and
being
in
an
agony
he
prayed
more
and
his
sweat
was
as
it
were
great
drops
of
blood
falling
down
to
the
and
when
he
rose
up
from
and
was
come
to
his
he
found
them
sleeping
for
and
said
unto
why

and
lest
ye
enter
into
and
while
he
yet
behold
a
and
he
that
was
called
one
of
the
went
before
and
drew
near
unto
jesus
to
kiss
but
jesus
said
unto
betrayest
thou
the
son
of
man
with
a
when
they
which
were
about
him
saw
what
would
they
said
unto
shall
we
smite
with
the
and
one
of
them
smote
the
servant
of
the
high
and
cut
off
his
right
and
jesus
answered
and
suffer
ye
thus
and
he
touched
his
and
healed
then
jesus
said
unto
the
chief
and
captains
of
the
and
the
which
were
come
to
be
ye
come
as
against
a
with
swords
and
when
i
was
daily
with
you
in
the
ye
stretched
forth
no
hands
against
but
this
is
your
and
the
power
of
then
took
they
and
led
and
brought
him
into
the
high
and
peter
followed
afar
and
when
they
had
kindled
a
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
and
were
set
down
peter
sat
down
among
but
a
certain
maid
beheld
him
as
he
sat
by
the
and
earnestly
looked
upon
and
this
man
was
also
with
and
he
denied
i
know
him
and
after
a
little
while
another
saw
and
thou
art
also
of
and
peter
i
am
and
about
the
space
of
one
hour
after
another
confidently
of
a
truth
this
also
was
with
for
he
is
a
and
peter
i
know
not
what
thou
and
while
he
yet
the
cock
and
the
lord
and
looked
upon
and
peter
remembered
the
word
of
the
how
he
had
said
unto
before
the
cock
thou
shalt
deny
me
and
peter
went
and
wept
and
the
men
that
held
jesus
mocked
and
smote
and
when
they
had
blindfolded
they
struck
him
on
the
and
asked
who
is
it
that
smote
and
many
other
things
blasphemously
spake
they
against
and
as
soon
as
it
was
the
elders
of
the
people
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
and
led
him
into
their
art
thou
the
tell
and
he
said
unto
if
i
tell
ye
will
not
and
if
i
also
ask
ye
will
not
answer
nor
let
hereafter
shall
the
son
of
man
sit
on
the
right
hand
of
the
power
of
then
said
they
art
thou
then
the
son
of
and
he
said
unto
ye
say
that
i
and
they
what
need
we
any
further
for
we
ourselves
have
heard
of
his
own
chapter
and
the
whole
multitude
of
them
and
led
him
unto
and
they
began
to
accuse
we
found
this
perverting
the
and
forbidding
to
give
tribute
to
saying
that
he
himself
is
christ
a
and
pilate
asked
art
thou
the
king
of
the
and
he
answered
him
and
thou
sayest
then
said
pilate
to
the
chief
priests
and
the
i
find
no
fault
in
this
and
they
were
the
more
he
stirreth
up
the
teaching
throughout
all
beginning
from
galilee
to
this
when
pilate
heard
of
he
asked
whether
the
man
were
a
and
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
he
belonged
unto
he
sent
him
to
who
himself
also
was
at
jerusalem
at
that
and
when
herod
saw
he
was
exceeding
for
he
was
desirous
to
see
him
of
a
long
because
he
had
heard
many
things
of
and
he
hoped
to
have
seen
some
miracle
done
by
then
he
questioned
with
him
in
many
but
he
answered
him
and
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
stood
and
vehemently
accused
and
herod
with
his
men
of
war
set
him
at
and
mocked
and
arrayed
him
in
a
gorgeous
and
sent
him
again
to
and
the
same
day
pilate
and
herod
were
made
friends
for
before
they
were
at
enmity
between
and
when
he
had
called
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
said
unto
ye
have
brought
this
man
unto
as
one
that
perverteth
the
having
examined
before
have
found
no
fault
in
this
man
touching
those
things
whereof
ye
accuse
nor
yet
for
i
sent
you
to
nothing
worthy
of
death
is
done
unto
i
will
therefore
chastise
and
release
of
necessity
he
must
release
one
unto
them
at
the
and
they
cried
out
all
at
away
with
this
and
release
unto
us
for
a
certain
sedition
made
in
the
and
for
was
cast
into
pilate
willing
to
release
spake
again
to
but
they
crucify
crucify
and
he
said
unto
them
the
third
what
evil
hath
he
i
have
found
no
cause
of
death
in
i
will
therefore
chastise
and
let
and
they
were
instant
with
loud
requiring
that
he
might
be
and
the
voices
of
them
and
of
the
chief
priests
and
pilate
gave
sentence
that
it
should
be
as
they
and
he
released
unto
them
him
that
for
sedition
and
murder
was
cast
into
whom
they
had
but
he
delivered
jesus
to
their
and
as
they
led
him
they
laid
hold
upon
one
a
coming
out
of
the
and
on
him
they
laid
the
that
he
might
bear
after
and
there
followed
him
a
great
company
of
and
of
which
also
bewailed
and
lamented
but
jesus
turning
unto
them
daughters
of
weep
not
for
but
weep
for
and
for
your
the
days
are
in
the
which
they
shall
blessed
the
and
the
wombs
that
never
and
the
paps
which
never
gave
then
shall
they
begin
to
say
to
the
fall
on
and
to
the
cover
for
if
they
do
these
things
in
a
green
what
shall
be
done
in
the
and
there
were
also
two
led
with
him
to
be
put
to
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
which
is
called
there
they
crucified
and
the
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
then
said
forgive
for
they
know
not
what
they
and
they
parted
his
and
cast
and
the
people
stood
and
the
rulers
also
with
them
derided
he
saved
let
him
save
if
he
be
the
chosen
of
and
the
soldiers
also
mocked
coming
to
and
offering
him
and
if
thou
be
the
king
of
the
save
and
a
superscription
also
was
written
over
him
in
letters
of
and
and
this
is
the
king
of
the
and
one
of
the
malefactors
which
were
hanged
railed
on
if
thou
be
save
thyself
and
but
the
other
answering
rebuked
dost
not
thou
fear
seeing
thou
art
in
the
same
and
we
indeed
for
we
receive
the
due
reward
of
our
but
this
man
hath
done
nothing
and
he
said
unto
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
and
jesus
said
unto
verily
i
say
unto
to
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
and
it
was
about
the
sixth
and
there
was
a
darkness
over
all
the
earth
until
the
ninth
and
the
sun
was
and
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
the
and
when
jesus
had
cried
with
a
loud
he
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
and
having
said
he
gave
up
the
now
when
the
centurion
saw
what
was
he
glorified
certainly
this
was
a
righteous
and
all
the
people
that
came
together
to
that
beholding
the
things
which
were
smote
their
and
and
all
his
and
the
women
that
followed
him
from
stood
afar
beholding
these
a
man
named
a
he
a
good
and
a
same
had
not
consented
to
the
counsel
and
deed
of
of
a
city
of
the
who
also
himself
waited
for
the
kingdom
of
this
went
unto
and
begged
the
body
of
and
he
took
it
and
wrapped
it
in
and
laid
it
in
a
sepulchre
that
was
hewn
in
wherein
never
man
before
was
and
that
day
was
the
and
the
sabbath
drew
and
the
women
which
came
with
him
from
followed
and
beheld
the
and
how
his
body
was
and
they
and
prepared
spices
and
and
rested
the
sabbath
day
according
to
the
chapter
now
upon
the
first
of
the
very
early
in
the
they
came
unto
the
bringing
the
spices
which
they
had
and
certain
with
and
they
found
the
stone
rolled
away
from
the
and
they
entered
and
found
not
the
body
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
as
they
were
much
perplexed
two
men
stood
by
them
in
shining
and
as
they
were
and
bowed
down
faces
to
the
they
said
unto
why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
he
is
not
but
is
remember
how
he
spake
unto
you
when
he
was
yet
in
the
son
of
man
must
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
sinful
and
be
and
the
third
day
rise
and
they
remembered
his
and
returned
from
the
and
told
all
these
things
unto
the
and
to
all
the
it
was
mary
and
and
mary
of
and
other
that
with
which
told
these
things
unto
the
and
their
words
seemed
to
them
as
idle
and
they
believed
them
then
arose
and
ran
unto
the
and
stooping
he
beheld
the
linen
clothes
laid
by
and
wondering
in
himself
at
that
which
was
come
to
two
of
them
went
that
same
day
to
a
village
called
which
was
from
jerusalem
threescore
and
they
talked
together
of
all
these
things
which
had
and
it
came
to
while
they
communed
and
jesus
himself
drew
and
went
with
but
their
eyes
were
holden
that
they
should
not
know
and
he
said
unto
what
manner
of
communications
these
that
ye
have
one
to
as
ye
and
are
and
the
one
of
whose
name
was
answering
said
unto
art
thou
only
a
stranger
in
and
hast
not
known
the
things
which
are
come
to
pass
there
in
these
and
he
said
unto
what
and
they
said
unto
concerning
jesus
of
which
was
a
prophet
mighty
in
deed
and
word
before
god
and
all
the
and
how
the
chief
priests
and
our
rulers
delivered
him
to
be
condemned
to
and
have
crucified
but
we
trusted
that
it
had
been
he
which
should
have
redeemed
and
beside
all
to
day
is
the
third
day
since
these
things
were
and
certain
women
also
of
our
company
made
us
which
were
early
at
the
and
when
they
found
not
his
they
that
they
had
also
seen
a
vision
of
which
said
that
he
was
and
certain
of
them
which
were
with
us
went
to
the
and
found
even
so
as
the
women
had
but
him
they
saw
then
he
said
unto
o
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
all
that
the
prophets
have
ought
not
christ
to
have
suffered
these
and
to
enter
into
his
and
beginning
at
moses
and
all
the
he
expounded
unto
them
in
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
and
they
drew
nigh
unto
the
whither
they
and
he
made
as
though
he
would
have
gone
but
they
constrained
abide
with
for
it
is
toward
and
the
day
is
far
and
he
went
in
to
tarry
with
and
it
came
to
as
he
sat
at
meat
with
he
took
and
blessed
and
and
gave
to
and
their
eyes
were
and
they
knew
and
he
vanished
out
of
their
and
they
said
one
to
did
not
our
heart
burn
within
while
he
talked
with
us
by
the
and
while
he
opened
to
us
the
and
they
rose
up
the
same
and
returned
to
and
found
the
eleven
gathered
and
them
that
were
with
the
lord
is
risen
and
hath
appeared
to
and
they
told
what
things
in
the
and
how
he
was
known
of
them
in
breaking
of
and
as
they
thus
jesus
himself
stood
in
the
midst
of
and
saith
unto
peace
unto
but
they
were
terrified
and
and
supposed
that
they
had
seen
a
and
he
said
unto
why
are
ye
and
why
do
thoughts
arise
in
your
behold
my
hands
and
my
that
it
is
i
handle
and
for
a
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
as
ye
see
me
and
when
he
had
thus
he
shewed
them
hands
and
and
while
they
yet
believed
not
for
and
he
said
unto
have
ye
here
any
and
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
broiled
and
of
an
and
he
took
and
did
eat
before
and
he
said
unto
these
the
words
which
i
spake
unto
while
i
was
yet
with
that
all
things
must
be
which
were
written
in
the
law
of
and
the
and
the
concerning
then
opened
he
their
that
they
might
understand
the
and
said
unto
thus
it
is
and
thus
it
behoved
christ
to
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
and
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
beginning
at
and
ye
are
witnesses
of
these
i
send
the
promise
of
my
father
upon
but
tarry
ye
in
the
city
of
until
ye
be
endued
with
power
from
on
and
he
led
them
out
as
far
as
to
and
he
lifted
up
his
and
blessed
and
it
came
to
while
he
blessed
he
was
parted
from
and
carried
up
into
and
they
worshipped
and
returned
to
jerusalem
with
great
and
were
continually
in
the
praising
and
blessing
the
gospel
according
to
saint
john
chapter
in
the
beginning
was
the
and
the
word
was
with
and
the
word
was
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
all
things
were
made
by
and
without
him
was
not
any
thing
made
that
was
in
him
was
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
and
the
light
shineth
in
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
there
was
a
man
sent
from
whose
name
the
same
came
for
a
to
bear
witness
of
the
that
all
through
him
might
he
was
not
that
but
to
bear
witness
of
that
was
the
true
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
he
was
in
the
and
the
world
was
made
by
and
the
world
knew
him
he
came
unto
his
and
his
own
received
him
but
as
many
as
received
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
to
them
that
believe
on
his
which
were
not
of
nor
of
the
will
of
the

of
the
will
of
but
of

the
word
was
made
and
dwelt
among

beheld
his
the
glory
as
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
full
of
grace
and

of
and
this
was
he
of
whom
i
he
that

before
for
he
was

of
his
fulness

man
hath
seen
god
at
any
the
only
begotten
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
he
hath
declared
and
this
is
the
record
of
when
the
jews
sent
priests
and
levites
from
jerusalem
to
ask
who
art
and
he
and
denied
but
i
am
not

and
they
asked
what
art
thou
and
he
i
am

thou
that
and
he
then
said
they
unto
who

that
we
may
give
an
answer
to
them
that

of
he
i
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
make
straight
the
way
of
the
as
said
the
prophet
and
they
which
were
sent
were
of
the
and
they
asked
and
said
unto
why
baptizest
thou
if
thou
be
not
that
nor
neither
that
john
answered
i

with
but
there
standeth
one
among
whom
ye
know
he
it
who
coming
after
me
is
preferred
before
whose
latchet
i
am
not
worthy
to
these
things
were
done
in
bethabara
beyond
where
john
was
the
next
day
john

away
the
sin
of
the
this
is
he
of
whom
i
after
me
cometh
a
man
which

should
be
made
manifest
to
therefore

me
to

the
same
said
unto

not
my
house
an
house
of
and
his
disciples
remembered
that
it
was
the
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
then
answered
the
jews
and
said
unto
what
sign
shewest
thou
unto
seeing
that
thou
doest
these
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
destroy
this
and
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
then
said
the
forty
and
six
years
was
this
temple
in
and
wilt
thou
rear
it
up
in
three
but
he
spake
of
the
temple
of
his
when
therefore
he
was
risen
from
the
his
disciples
remembered
that
he
had
said
this
unto
and
they
believed
the
and
the
word
which
jesus
had
now
when
he
was
in
jerusalem
at
the
in
the
feast
many
believed
in
his
when
they
saw
the
miracles
which
he
but
jesus
did
not
commit
himself
unto
because
he
knew
all
and
needed
not
that
any
should
testify
of
for
he
knew
what
was
in
chapter
there
was
a
man
of
the
named
a
ruler
of
the
the
same
came
to
jesus
by
and
said
unto
we
know
that
thou
art
a
teacher
come
from
for
no
man
can
do
these
miracles
that
thou
except
god
be
with
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
i
say
unto
except
a
man
be
born
he
cannot
see
the
kingdom
of
nicodemus
saith
unto
how
can
a
man
be
born
when
he
is
can
he
enter
the
second
time
into
his
and
be
jesus
i
say
unto
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
the
he
cannot
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
marvel
not
that
i
said
unto
ye
must
be
born
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
and
thou
hearest
the
sound
but
canst
not
tell
whence
it
and
whither
it
so
is
every
one
that
is
born
of
the
nicodemus
answered
and
said
unto
how
can
these
things
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
art
thou
a
master
of
and
knowest
not
these
i
say
unto
we
speak
that
we
do
and
testify
that
we
have
and
ye
receive
not
our
if
i
have
told
you
earthly
and
ye
believe
how
shall
ye
if
i
tell
you
heavenly
and
no
man
hath
ascended
up
to
but
he
that
came
down
from
the
son
of
man
which
is
in
and
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
even
so
must
the
son
of
man
be
lifted
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
but
have
eternal
for
god
so
loved
the
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
but
have
everlasting
for
god
sent
not
his
son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
he
that
believeth
on
him
is
not
but
he
that
believeth
not
is
condemned
because
he
hath
not
believed
in
the
name
of
the
only
begotten
son
of
and
this
is
the
that
light
is
come
into
the
and
men
loved
darkness
rather
than
because
their
deeds
were
for
every
one
that
doeth
evil
hateth
the
neither
cometh
to
the
lest
his
deeds
should
be
but
he
that
doeth
truth
cometh
to
the
that
his
deeds
may
be
made
that
they
are
wrought
in
after
these
things
came
jesus
and
his
disciples
into
the
land
of
and
there
he
tarried
with
and
and
john
also
was
baptizing
in
aenon
near
to
because
there
was
much
water
and
they
and
were
for
john
was
not
yet
cast
into
then
there
arose
a
question
between
of
disciples
and
the
jews
about
and
they
came
unto
and
said
unto
he
that
was
with
thee
beyond
to
whom
thou
barest
the
same
and
all
come
to
john
answered
and
a
man
can
receive
except
it
be
given
him
from
ye
yourselves
bear
me
that
i
i
am
not
the
but
that
i
am
sent
before
he
that
hath
the
bride

the
but
the
friend
of
the
which
standeth
and
heareth

greatly
because
of
the
this
my
joy
therefore
is

i
he
that
cometh
from
above

above
and
what
he
hath
seen
and
that
he
and
no
man
receiveth
his
he
that
hath
received
his
testimony
hath
set
to
his
seal
that
god
is
for
he
whom
god
hath
sent
speaketh
the
words
of
for
god
giveth
not
the
spirit
by
measure
the
father
loveth
the
and
hath
given
all
things
into
his
he
that
believeth
on
the
son
hath
everlasting
and
he
that
believeth
not
the
son
shall
not
see
but
the
wrath
of
god
abideth
on
chapter
when
therefore
the
lord
knew
how
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
jesus
made
and
baptized
more
disciples
than
jesus
himself
baptized
but
his
he
left
and
departed
again
into
and
he
must
needs
go
through
then
cometh
he
to
a
city
of
which
is
called
near
to
the
parcel
of
ground
that
jacob
gave
to
his
son
now
well
was
jesus
being
wearied
with

thus
on
the
it

saith
unto

away
unto

saith
the
woman
of
samaria
unto

a
askest
drink
of
which

a
woman
of

answered
and
said
unto

who
it
is
that

to
give
me
to
thou
wouldest
have
asked
of

he
would
have
given
thee
living
the
woman
saith
unto
thou
hast
nothing

and
the
well
is
from
whence
then
hast
thou
that
living
art
thou
greater
than
our
father
which
gave
us
the
and
drank
thereof
and
his
and
his
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
whosoever
drinketh
of
this
water
shall
thirst
but
whosoever
drinketh
of
the
water
that
i
shall
give
him
shall
never

the
water
that

be
in
him
a
well
of
water
springing
up
into

woman
answered
and
i
have
no
jesus
said
unto
thou

i
have
no
for
thou
hast
had
five
and
he
whom
thou
now
hast
is
not
thy

that
saidst
thou
the
woman
saith
unto
i
perceive
that
thou
art
a
our
fathers
worshipped
in
this
and
ye
that
in
jerusalem
is
the
place
where
men
ought
to
jesus

unto
believe
the
hour
when

this
nor
yet
at

the
ye
worship
ye
know
not
we
know
what
we
for

the
hour
and
now
when
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the

in
spirit
and
in
for
the

is
he
will
tell
us
all
jesus
saith
unto
i
that
speak
unto
thee

and
upon
this
came
his
and
marvelled
that
he
talked
with
the
yet
no
man
what
seekest
why
talkest
thou
with
the
woman
then
left
her
and
went
her
way
into
the
and
saith
to
the
see
a
which
told
me
all
things
that
ever
i
is
not
this
the
then
they
went
out
of
the
and
came
unto
in
the
mean
while
his
disciples
prayed
but
he
said
unto
i
have
meat
to
eat
that
ye
know
not
therefore
said
the
disciples
one
to
hath
any
man
brought
him
to
jesus
saith
unto
my
meat
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
that
sent
and
to
finish
his
say
not
there
are
yet
four
and
cometh
i
say
unto
lift
up
your
and
look
on
the
for
they
are
white
already
to
and
he
that
reapeth
receiveth
and
gathereth
fruit
unto
life
that
both
he
that
soweth
and
he
that
reapeth
may
rejoice
and
herein
is
that
saying
one
and
another
i
sent
you
to
reap
that
whereon
ye
bestowed
no
other
men
and
ye
are
entered
into
their
and
many
of
the
samaritans
of
that
city
believed
on
him
for
the
saying
of
the
which
he
told
me
all
that
ever
i
so
when
the
samaritans
were
come
unto
they
besought
him
that
he
would
tarry
with
and
he
abode
there
two
and
many
more
believed
because
of
his
own
and
said
unto
the
now
we
not
because
of
thy
for
we
have
heard
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
the
saviour
of
the
now
after
two
days
he
departed
and
went
into
for
jesus
himself
that
a
prophet
hath
no
honour
in
his
own
then
when
he
was
come
into
the
galilaeans
received
having
seen
all
the
things
that
he
did
at
jerusalem
at
the
for
they
also
went
unto
the
so
jesus
came
again
into
cana
of
where
he
made
the
water
and
there
was
a
certain
whose
son
was
sick
at
when
he
heard
that
jesus
was
come
out
of
judaea
into
he
went
unto
and
besought
him
that
he
would
come
and
heal
his
for
he
was
at
the
point
of
then
said
jesus
unto
except
ye
see
signs
and
ye
will
not
the
nobleman
saith
unto
come
down
ere
my
child
jesus
saith
unto
go
thy
thy
son
and
the
man
believed
the
word
that
jesus
had
spoken
unto
and
he
went
his
and
as
he
was
now
going
his
servants
met
and
told
thy
son
then
enquired
he
of
them
the
hour
when
he
began
to
and
they
said
unto
yesterday
at
the
seventh
hour
the
fever
left
so
the
father
knew
that
at
the
same
in
the
which
jesus
said
unto
thy
son
and
himself
and
his
whole
this
again
the
second
miracle
jesus
when
he
was
come
out
of
judaea
into
chapter
after
this
there
was
a
feast
of
the
and
jesus
went
up
to
now
there
is
at
jerusalem
by
the
sheep
a
which
is
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
having
five
in
these
lay
a
great
multitude
of
impotent
of
waiting
for
the
moving
of
the
for
an
angel
went
down
at
a
certain
season
into
the
and
troubled
the
whosoever
then
first
after
the
troubling
of
the
water
stepped
in
was
made
whole
of
whatsoever
disease
he
and
a
certain
man
was
which
had
an
infirmity
thirty
and
eight
when
jesus
saw
him
and
knew
that
he
had
been
now
a
long
time
that
he
saith
unto
wilt
thou
be
made
the
impotent
man
answered
i
have
no
when
the
water
is
to
put
me
into
the
but
while
i
am
another
steppeth
down
before
jesus
saith
unto
take
up
thy
and
and
immediately
the
man
was
made
and
took
up
his
and
and
on
the
same
day
was
the
the
jews
therefore
said
unto
him
that
was
it
is
the
sabbath
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
carry
he
answered
he
that
made
me
the
same
said
unto
take
up
thy
and
then
asked
they
what
man
is
that
which
said
unto
take
up
thy
and
and
he
that
was
healed
wist
not
who
it
for
jesus
had
conveyed
himself
a
multitude
being
in
afterward
jesus
findeth
him
in
the
and
said
unto
thou
art
made
sin
no
lest
a
worse
thing
come
unto
the
man
and
told
the
jews
that
it
was
which
had
made
him
and
therefore
did
the
jews
persecute
and
sought
to
slay
because
he
had
done
these
things
on
the
sabbath
but
jesus
answered
my
father
worketh
and
i
therefore
the
jews
sought
the
more
to
kill
because
he
not
only
had
broken
the
but
said
also
that
god
was
his
making
himself
equal
with
then
answered
jesus
and
said
unto
i
say
unto
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
but
what
he
seeth
the
father
for
what
things
soever
he
these
also
doeth
the
son
for
the
father
loveth
the
and
sheweth
him
all
things
that
himself
and
he
will
shew
him
greater
works
than
that
ye
may
for
as
the
father
raiseth
up
the
and
quickeneth
even
so
the
son
quickeneth
whom
he
for
the
father
judgeth
no
but
hath
committed
all
judgment
unto
the
that
all
should
honour
the
even
as
they
honour
the
he
that
honoureth
not
the
son
honoureth
not
the
father
which
hath
sent
i

unto
the
hour

now
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the

they
that
hear
shall
for
as
the
father
hath
life
in
so
hath
he
given
to
the
son
to
have
life
in

hath
given
him
authority
to
execute
judgment
because
he
is
the
son
of
marvel
not
at
for
the
hour
is
in
the
which
all
that
are
in
the
graves
shall
hear
his
and
shall

they
that
have
done
unto
the
resurrection
of
i
can
of
mine
own
self
do
as
i
i
and
my
judgment
is
because
i
seek
not
mine
own
but
the
will
of
the
father
which
hath
sent
if
i
bear
witness
of
my
witness
is
not
there
is
another
that
beareth
witness
of
and
i
know
that
the
witness
which
he
witnesseth
of
me
is
ye
sent
unto
and
he
bare
witness
unto
the
but
i
receive
not
testimony
from
but
these
things
i
that
ye
might
be
he
was
a
burning
and
a
shining
and
ye
were
willing
for
a
season
to
rejoice
in
his
but
i
have
greater
witness
than
of
for
the
works
which
the
father
hath
given
me
to
the
same
works
that
i
bear
witness
of
that
the
father
hath
sent
and
the
father
which
hath
sent
hath
borne
witness
of
ye
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
nor
seen
his
and
ye
have
not
his
word
abiding
in
for
whom
he
hath
him
ye
believe
search
the
for
in
them
ye
think
ye
have
eternal
and
they
are
they
which
testify
of
and
ye
will
not
come
to
that
ye
might
have
i
receive
not
honour
from
but
i
know
that
ye
have
not
the
love
of
god
in
i
am
come
in
my
and
ye
receive
me
if
another
shall
come
in
his
own
him
ye
will
how
can
ye
which
receive
honour
one
of
and
seek
not
the
honour
that
from
god
do
not
think
that
i
will
accuse
you
to
the
there
is
that
accuseth
in
whom
ye
for
had
ye
believed
ye
would
have
believed
for
he
wrote
of
but
if
ye
believe
not
his
how
shall
ye
believe
my
chapter
after
these
things
jesus
went
over
the
sea
of
which
is
of
and
a
great
multitude
followed
because
they
saw
his
miracles
which
he
did
on
them
that
were
and
jesus
went
up
into
a
and
there
he
sat
with
his
and
the
a
feast
of
the
was
when
jesus
then
lifted
up
and
saw
a
great
company
come
unto
he
saith
unto
whence
shall
we
buy
that
these
may
and
this
he
said
to
prove
for
he
himself
knew
what
he
would
philip
answered
two
hundred
pennyworth
of
bread
is
not
sufficient
for
that
every
one
of
them
may
take
a
one
of
his
simon
saith
unto
there
is
a
lad
which
hath
five
barley
and
two
small
but
what
are
they
among
so
and
jesus
make
the
men
sit
now
there
was
much
grass
in
the
so
the
men
sat
in
number
about
five
and
jesus
took
the
and
when
he
had
given
he
distributed
to
the
and
the
disciples
to
them
that
were
set
and
likewise
of
the
fishes
as
much
as
they
when
they
were
he
said
unto
his
gather
up
the
fragments
that
that
nothing
be
therefore
they
gathered
and
filled
twelve
baskets
with
the
fragments
of
the
five
barley
which
remained
over
and
above
unto
them
that
had
then
those
when
they
had
seen
the
miracle
that
jesus
this
is
of
a
truth
that
prophet
that
should
come
into
the
when
jesus
therefore
perceived
that
they
would
come
and
take
him
by
to
make
him
a
he
departed
again
into
a
mountain
himself
and
when
even
was
his
disciples
went
down
unto
the
and
entered
into
a
and
went
over
the
sea
toward
and
it
was
now
and
jesus
was
not
come
to
and
the
sea
arose
by
reason
of
a
great
wind
that
so
when
they
had
rowed
about
five
and
twenty
or
thirty
they
see
jesus
walking
on
the
and
drawing
nigh
unto
the
and
they
were
but
he
saith
unto
it
is
be
not
then
they
willingly
received
him
into
the
and
immediately
the
ship
was
at
the
land
whither
they
the
day
when
the
people
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
none
other
boat
save
that
one
whereinto
his
disciples
were
and
that
jesus
went
not
with
his
disciples
into
the
but
his
disciples
were
gone
away
there
came
other
boats
from
tiberias
nigh
unto
the
place
where
they
did
eat
after
that
the
lord
had
given
when
the
people
therefore
saw
that
jesus
was
not
neither
his
they
also
took
and
came
to
seeking
for
and
when
they
had
found
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
they
said
unto
when
camest
thou
jesus
answered
them
and
i
say
unto
ye
seek
not
because
ye
saw
the
but
because
ye
did
eat
of
the
and
were
labour
not
for
the
meat
which
but
for
that
meat
which
endureth
unto
everlasting
which
the
son
of
man
shall
give
unto
for
him
hath
god
the
father
then
said
they
unto
what
shall
we
that
we
might
work
the
works
of
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
this
is
the
work
of
that
ye
believe
on
him
whom
he
hath
they
said
therefore
unto
what
sign
shewest
thou
that
we
may
and
believe
what
dost
thou
our
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
as
it
is
he
gave
them
bread
from
heaven
to
then
jesus
said
unto
i
say
unto
moses
gave
you
not
that
bread
from
but
my
father
giveth
you
the
true
bread
from
for
the
bread
of
god
is
he
which
cometh
down
from
and
giveth
life
unto
the
then
said
they
unto
evermore
give
us
this
and
jesus
said
unto
i
am
the
bread
of
he
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
and
he
that
believeth
on
me
shall
never
but
i
said
unto
that
ye
also
have
seen
and
believe
all
that
the
father
giveth
me
shall
come
to
and
him
that
cometh
to
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
for
i
came
down
from
not
to
do
mine
own
but
the
will
of
him
that
sent
and
this
is
the
will
which
hath
sent
that
of
all
which
he
hath
given
me
i
should
lose
but
should
raise
it
up
again
at
the
last
and
this
is
the
will
of
him
that
sent
that
every
one
which
seeth
the
and
believeth
on
may
have
everlasting
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
the
jews
then
murmured
at
because
he
i
am
the
bread
which
came
down
from
and
they
is
not
this
the
son
of
whose
father
and
mother
we
how
is
it
then
that
he
i
came
down
from
jesus
therefore
answered
and
said
unto
murmur
not
among
no
man
can
come
to
except
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
it
is
written
in
the
and
they
shall
be
all
taught
of
every
man
therefore
that
hath
and
hath
learned
of
the
cometh
unto
not
that
any
man
hath
seen
the
save
he
which
is
of
he
hath
seen
the
i
say
unto
he
that
believeth
on
me
hath
everlasting
i
am
that
bread
of
your
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
and
are
this
is
the
bread
which
cometh
down
from
that
a
man
may
eat
and
not
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
if
any
man
eat
of
this
he
shall
live
for
and
the
bread
that
i
will
give
is
my
which
i
will
give
for
the
life
of
the
the
jews
therefore
strove
among
how
can
this
man
give
us
flesh
to
then
jesus
said
unto
i
say
unto
except
ye
eat
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
and
drink
his
ye
have
no
life
in
whoso
eateth
my
and
drinketh
my
hath
eternal
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
for
my
flesh
is
meat
and
my
blood
is
drink
he
that
eateth
my
and
drinketh
my
dwelleth
in
and
i
in
as
the
living
father
hath
sent
and
i
live
by
the
so
he
that
eateth
even
he
shall
live
by
this
is
that
bread
which
came
down
from
not
as
your
fathers
did
eat
and
are
he
that
eateth
of
this
bread
shall
live
for
these
things
said
he
in
the
as
he
taught
in
many
therefore
of
his
when
they
had
heard
this
is
an
hard
who
can
hear
when
jesus
knew
in
himself
that
his
disciples
murmured
at
he
said
unto
doth
this
offend
and
if
ye
shall
see
the
son
of
man
ascend
up
where
he
was
it
is
the
spirit
that
the
flesh
profiteth
the
words
that
i
speak
unto
are
and
are
but
there
are
some
of
you
that
believe
for
jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
who
they
were
that
believed
and
who
should
betray
and
he
therefore
said
i
unto
that
no
man
can
come
unto
except
it
were
given
unto
him
of
my
from
that
many
of
his
disciples
went
and
walked
no
more
with
then
said
jesus
unto
the
will
ye
also
go
then
simon
peter
answered
to
whom
shall
we
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
and
we
believe
and
are
sure
that
thou
art
that
the
son
of
the
living
jesus
answered
have
not
i
chosen
you
and
one
of
you
is
a
he
spake
of
judas
iscariot
of
for
he
it
was
that
should
betray
being
one
of
the
chapter
after
these
things
jesus
walked
in
for
he
would
not
walk
in
because
the
jews
sought
to
kill
now
the
feast
of
tabernacles
was
at
his
brethren
therefore
said
unto
depart
and
go
into
that
thy
disciples
also
may
see
the
works
that
thou
for
no
man
doeth
any
thing
in
and
he
himself
seeketh
to
be
known
if
thou
do
these
shew
thyself
to
the
for
neither
did
his
brethren
believe
in
then
jesus
said
unto
my
time
is
not
yet
but
your
time
is
alway
the
world
cannot
hate
but
me
it
because
i
testify
of
that
the
works
thereof
are
go
ye
up
unto
this
i
go
not
up
yet
unto
this
for
my
time
is
not
yet
full
when
he
had
said
these
words
unto
he
abode
in
but
when
his
brethren
were
gone
then
went
he
also
up
unto
the
not
but
as
it
were
in
then
the
jews
sought
him
at
the
and
where
is
and
there
was
much
murmuring
among
the
people
concerning
for
some
he
is
a
good
others
but
he
deceiveth
the
howbeit
no
man
spake
openly
of
him
for
fear
of
the
now
about
the
midst
of
the
feast
jesus
went
up
into
the
and
and
the
jews
how
knoweth
this
man
having
never
jesus
answered
and
my
doctrine
is
not
but
his
that
sent
if
any
man
will
do
his
he
shall
know
of
the
whether
it
be
of
or
i
speak
of
he
that
speaketh
of
himself
seeketh
his
own
but
he
that
seeketh
his
glory
that
sent
the
same
is
and
no
unrighteousness
is
in
did
not
moses
give
you
the
and
none
of
you
keepeth
the
why
go
ye
about
to
kill
the
people
answered
and
thou
hast
a
who
goeth
about
to
kill
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
i
have
done
one
and
ye
all
moses
therefore
gave
unto
you
because
it
is
of
but
of
the
and
ye
on
the
sabbath
day
circumcise
a
if
a
man
on
the
sabbath
day
receive
that
the
law
of
moses
should
not
be
are
ye
angry
at
because
i
have
made
a
man
every
whit
whole
on
the
sabbath
judge
not
according
to
the
but
judge
righteous
then
said
some
of
them
of
is
not
this
whom
they
seek
to
he
speaketh
and
they
say
nothing
unto
do
the
rulers
know
indeed
that
this
is
the
very
howbeit
we
know
this
man
whence
he
but
when
christ
no
man
knoweth
whence
he
then
cried
jesus
in
the
temple
as
he
ye
both
know
and
ye
know
whence
i
and
i
am
not
come
of
but
he
that
sent
me
is
whom
ye
know
but
i
know
for
i
am
from
and
he
hath
sent
then
they
sought
to
take
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
and
many
of
the
people
believed
on
and
when
christ
will
he
do
more
miracles
than
these
which
this
hath
the
pharisees
heard
that
the
people
murmured
such
things
concerning
and
the
pharisees
and
the
chief
priests
sent
officers
to
take
then
said
jesus
unto
yet
a
little
while
am
i
with
and
i
go
unto
him
that
sent
ye
shall
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
where
i
ye
cannot
then
said
the
jews
among
whither
will
he
that
we
shall
not
find
will
he
go
unto
the
dispersed
among
the
and
teach
the
what
saying
is
this
that
he
ye
shall
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
where
i
ye
cannot
in
the
last
that
great
of
the
jesus
stood
and
if
any
man
let
him
come
unto
and
he
that
believeth
on
as
the
scripture
hath
out
of
his
belly
shall
flow
rivers
of
living
this
spake
he
of
the
which
they
that
believe
on
him
should
for
the
holy
ghost
was
not
yet
because
that
jesus
was
not
yet
many
of
the
people
when
they
heard
this
of
a
truth
this
is
the
others
this
is
the
but
some
shall
christ
come
out
of
hath
not
the
scripture
that
christ
cometh
of
the
seed
of
and
out
of
the
town
of
where
david
so
there
was
a
division
among
the
people
because
of
and
some
of
them
would
have
taken
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
then
came
the
officers
to
the
chief
priests
and
and
they
said
unto
why
have
ye
not
brought
the
officers
never
man
spake
like
this
then
answered
them
the
are
ye
also
have
any
of
the
rulers
or
of
the
pharisees
believed
on
but
this
people
who
knoweth
not
the
law
are
nicodemus
saith
unto
that
came
to
jesus
by
being
one
of
doth
our
law
judge
before
it
hear
and
know
what
he
they
answered
and
said
unto
art
thou
also
of
and
for
out
of
galilee
ariseth
no
and
every
man
went
unto
his
own
chapter
jesus
went
unto
the
mount
of
and
early
in
the
morning
he
came
again
into
the
and
all
the
people
came
unto
and
he
sat
and
taught
and
the
scribes
and
pharisees
brought
unto
him
a
woman
taken
in
and
when
they
had
set
her
in
the
they
say
unto
this
woman
was
taken
in
in
the
very
now
moses
in
the
law
commanded
that
such
should
be
but
what
sayest
this
they
tempting
that
they
might
have
to
accuse
but
jesus
stooped
and
with
finger
wrote
on
the
though
he
heard
them
so
when
they
continued
asking
he
lifted
up
and
said
unto
he
that
is
without
sin
among
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
and
again
he
stooped
and
wrote
on
the
and
they
which
heard
being
convicted
by
went
out
one
by
beginning
at
the
unto
the
and
jesus
was
left
and
the
woman
standing
in
the
when
jesus
had
lifted
up
and
saw
none
but
the
he
said
unto
where
are
those
thine
hath
no
man
condemned
she
no
and
jesus
said
unto
neither
do
i
condemn
and
sin
no
then
spake
jesus
again
unto
i
am
the
light
of
the
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
but
shall
have
the
light
of
the
pharisees
therefore
said
unto
thou
bearest
record
of
thy
record
is
not
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
though
i
bear
record
of
my
record

they
unto

have
known
my
father
these
words
spake
jesus
in
the
as
he
taught
in
the
and
no
man
laid
hands
on
for
his
hour
was
not

then
said
jesus
again
unto
i

and
ye
shall
seek
and
shall
die
in
your
whither
i
ye

he
said
unto
ye

from
ye

of
this
i

i
said
therefore
unto
that

in
your
for
if
ye
believe
not
that
i
am
ye
shall
die
in
your
then
said
they
unto
who

jesus
saith
unto
even
that
i
said
unto
you
from
the
i
have
many
things
to
say
and
to
judge
of
but
he
that
sent
me
is
and
i
speak
to
the
world
those
things
which
i
have
heard
of
they
understood
not
that
he
spake
to
them
of
the
then
said
jesus
unto
when
ye
have
lifted
up
the
son
of
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
am
and
i
do
nothing
of
but
as
my
father
hath
taught
i
speak
these
and
he
that
sent
me
is
with
the
father
hath
not
left
me
for
i
do
always
those
things
that
please
as
he
spake
these
many
believed
on
then
said
jesus
to
those
jews
which
believed
on
if
ye
continue
in
my
are
ye
my
disciples
and
ye
shall
know
the
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
they
answered
we
be
and
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
how
sayest
ye
shall
be
made
jesus
answered
i
say
unto
whosoever
committeth
sin
is
the
servant
of
and
the
servant
abideth
not
in
the
house
for
the
son
abideth
if
the
son
therefore
shall
make
you
ye
shall
be
free
i
know
that
ye
are
but
ye
seek
to
kill
because
my
word
hath
no
place
in
i
speak
that
which
i
have
seen
with
my
and
ye
do
that
which
ye
have
seen
with
your
they
answered
and
said
unto
abraham
is
our
jesus
saith
unto
if
ye
were
ye
would
do
the
works
of
but
now
ye
seek
to
kill
a
man
that
hath
told
you
the
which
i
have
heard
of
this
did
not
ye
do
the
deeds
of
your
then
said
they
to
we

one
jesus
said
unto
if
god
were
your
ye
would
love
for
i
proceeded
forth
and
came
from
neither
came
i
of
but
he
sent
why
do
ye
not
understand
my
because
ye
cannot
hear
my
ye
are
of
father
the
and
the
lusts
of
your
father
ye
will
he
was
a
murderer
from
the
and
abode
not
in
the
because
there
is
no
truth
in
when
he
speaketh
a
he
speaketh
of
his
for
he
is
a
and
the
father
of
and
because
i
tell
the
ye
believe
me
which
of
you
convinceth
me
of
and
if
i
say
the
why
do
ye
not
believe
he
that
is
of
god
heareth
ye
therefore
hear
because
ye
are
not
of
then
answered
the
and
said
unto
say
we
not
well
that
thou
art
a
and
hast
a
jesus
i
have
not
a
but
i
honour
my
and
ye
do
dishonour
and
i
seek
not
mine
own
there
is
one
that
seeketh
and
i
say
unto
if
a
man
keep
my
he
shall
never
see
then
said
the
jews
unto
now
we
know
that
thou
hast
a
abraham
is
and
the
and
thou
if
a
man
keep
my
he
shall
never
taste
of
art
thou
greater
than
our
father
which
is
and
the
prophets
are
whom
makest
thou
jesus
if
i
honour
my
honour
is
it
is
my
father
that
honoureth
of
whom
ye
that
he
is
your
yet
ye
have
not
known
but
i
know
and
if
i
should
i
know
him
i
shall
be
a
liar
like
unto
but
i
know
and
keep
his
your
father
abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
and
he
saw
and
was
then
said
the
jews
unto
thou
art
not
yet
fifty
years
and
hast
thou
seen
jesus
said
unto
i
say
unto
before
abraham
i
then
took
they
up
stones
to
cast
at
but
jesus
hid
and
went
out
of
the
going
through
the
midst
of
and
so
passed
chapter
and
as
passed
he
saw
a
man
which
was
blind
from
and
his
disciples
asked
who
did
this
or
his
that
he
was
born
jesus
neither
hath
this
man
nor
his
but
that
the
works
of
god
should
be
made
manifest
in
i
must
work
the
works
of
him
that
sent
while
it
is
the
night
when
no
man
can
as
long
as
i
am
in
the
i
am
the
light
of
the
when
he
had
thus
he
spat
on
the
and
made
clay
of
the
and
he
anointed
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
with
the
and
said
unto
wash
in
the
pool
of
is
by
he
went
his
way
and
and
came
the
neighbours
and
they
which
before
had
seen
him
that
he
was
is
not
this
he
that
sat
and
some
this
is
others
he
is
like
he
i
am
therefore
said
they
unto
how
were
thine
eyes
he
answered
and
a
man
that
is
called
jesus
made
and
anointed
mine
and
said
unto
go
to
the
pool
of
and
and
i
went
and
and
i
received
then
said
they
unto
where
is
he
i
know
they
brought
to
the
pharisees
him
that
aforetime
was
and
it
was
the
sabbath
day
when
jesus
made
the
and
opened
his
then
again
the
pharisees
also
asked
him
how
he
had
received
his
he
said
unto
he
put
clay
upon
mine
and
i
and
do
therefore
said
some
of
the
this
man
is
not
of
because
he
keepeth
not
the
sabbath
others
how
can
a
man
that
is
a
sinner
do
such
and
there
was
a
division
among
they
say
unto
the
blind
man
what
sayest
thou
of
that
he
hath
opened
thine
he
he
is
a
but
the
jews
did
not
believe
concerning
that
he
had
been
and
received
his
until
they
called
the
parents
of
him
that
had
received
his
and
they
asked
is
this
your
who
ye
say
was
born
how
then
doth
he
now
his
parents
answered
them
and
we
know
that
this
is
our
and
that
he
was
born
but
by
what
means
he
now
we
know
or
who
hath
opened
his
we
know
he
is
of
ask
he
shall
speak
for
these
spake
his
because
they
feared
the
for
the
jews
had
agreed
that
if
any
man
did
confess
that
he
was
he
should
be
put
out
of
the
therefore
said
his
he
is
of
ask
then
again
called
they
the
man
that
was
and
said
unto
give
god
the
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
he
answered
and
whether
he
be
a
sinner
i
know
one
thing
i
whereas
i
was
now
i
then
said
they
to
him
what
did
he
to
how
opened
he
thine
he
answered
i
have
told
you
and
ye
did
not
wherefore
would
ye
hear
will
ye
also
be
his
then
they
reviled
and
thou
art
his
but
we
are
we
know
that
god
spake
unto
this
we
know
not
from
whence
he
the
man
answered
and
said
unto
why
herein
is
a
marvellous
that
ye
know
not
from
whence
he
and
he
hath
opened
mine
now
we
know
that
god
heareth
not
but
if
any
man
be
a
worshipper
of
and
doeth
his
him
he
since
the
world
began
was
it
not
heard
that
any
man
opened
the
eyes
of
one
that
was
born
if
this
man
were
not
of
he
could
do
they
answered
and
said
unto
thou
wast
altogether
born
in
and
dost
thou
teach
and
they
cast
him
jesus
heard
that
they
had
cast
him
and
when
he
had
found
he
said
unto
dost
thou
believe
on
the
son
of
he
answered
and
who
is
that
i
might
believe
on
and
jesus
said
unto
thou
hast
both
seen
and
it
is
he
that
talketh
with
and
he
i
and
he
worshipped
and
jesus
for
judgment
i
am
come
into
this
that
they
which
see
not
might
and
that
they
which
see
might
be
made
and
of
the
pharisees
which
were
with
him
heard
these
and
said
unto
are
we
blind
jesus
said
unto
if
ye
were
ye
should
have
no
but
now
ye
we
therefore
your
sin
chapter
i
say
unto
he
that
entereth
not
by
the
door
into
the
but
climbeth
up
some
other
the
same
is
a
thief
and
a
but
he
that
entereth
in
by
the
door
is
the
shepherd
of
the
to
him
the
porter
and
the
sheep
hear
his
and
he
calleth
his
own
sheep
by
and
leadeth
them
and
when
he
putteth
forth
his
own
he
goeth
before
and
the
sheep
follow
for
they
know
his
and
a
stranger
will
they
not
but
will
flee
from
for
they
know
not
the
voice
of
this
parable
spake
jesus
unto
but
they
understood
not
what
things
they
were
which
he
spake
unto
then
said
jesus
unto
them
i
say
unto
i
am
the
door
of
the
all
that
ever
came
before
me
are
thieves
and
but
the
sheep
did
not
hear
i
am
the
by
me
if
any
man
enter
he
shall
be
and
shall
go
in
and
and
find
the
thief
cometh
but
for
to
and
to
and
to
i
am
come
that
they
might
have
and
that
they
might
have
more
i
am
the
good
the
good
shepherd
giveth
his
life
for
the
but
he
that
is
an
and
not
the
whose
own
the
sheep
are
seeth
the
wolf
and
leaveth
the
and
and
the
wolf
catcheth
and
scattereth
the
the
hireling
because
he
is
an
and
careth
not
for
the
i
am
the
good
and
know
my
and
am
known
of
as
the
father
knoweth
even
so
know
i
the
and
i
lay
down
my
life
for
the
and
other
sheep
i
which
are
not
of
this
them
also
i
must
and
they
shall
hear
my
and
there
shall
be
one
one
therefore
doth
my
father
love
because
i
lay
down
my
that
i
might
take
it
no
man
taketh
it
from
but
i
lay
it
down
of
i
have
power
to
lay
it
and
i
have
power
to
take
it
this
commandment
have
i
received
of
my
there
was
a
division
therefore
again
among
the
jews
for
these
and
many
of
them
he
hath
a
and
is
why
hear
ye
others
these
are
not
the
words
of
him
that
hath
a
can
a
devil
open
the
eyes
of
the
and
it
was
at
jerusalem
the
feast
of
the
and
it
was
and
jesus
walked
in
the
temple
in
then
came
the
jews
round
about
and
said
unto
how
long
dost
thou
make
us
to
if
thou
be
the
tell
us
jesus
answered
i
told
and
ye
believed
the
works
that
i
do
in
my
they
bear
witness
of
but
ye
believe
because
ye
are
not
of
my
as
i
said
unto
my
sheep
hear
my
and
i
know
and
they
follow
and
i
give
unto
them
eternal
and
they
shall
never
neither
shall
any
pluck
them
out
of
my
my
which
gave
is
greater
than
and
no
is
able
to
pluck
out
of
my
i
and
father
are
then
the
jews
took
up
stones
again
to
stone
jesus
answered
many
good
works
have
i
shewed
you
from
my
for
which
of
those
works
do
ye
stone
the
jews
answered
for
a
good
work
we
stone
thee
but
for
and
because
that
being
a
makest
thyself
jesus
answered
is
it
not
written
in
your
i
ye
are
if
he
called
them
unto
whom
the
word
of
god
and
the
scripture
cannot
be
say
ye
of
whom
the
father
hath
and
sent
into
the

because
i
i
am
the

though
ye
believe
not
believe

that
ye
may

they
sought

he
escaped
out
of
their

went
away
again
beyond
jordan
into
the
place
where

there
he
and

of
the
have
caused
that
even
this
man
should
not
have
jesus
therefore
again
groaning
in
himself
cometh
to
the
it
was
a
and
a
stone
lay
upon
jesus
take
ye
away
the
the
sister
of
him
that
was
saith
unto
by
this
time
he
for
he
hath
been
four
jesus
saith
unto
said
i
not
unto
if
thou
wouldest
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
of
then
they
took
away
the
stone
the
where
the
dead
was
and
jesus
lifted
up
and
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
and
i
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
i
said
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
and
when
he
thus
had
he
cried
with
a
loud
come
and
he
that
was
dead
came
bound
hand
and
foot
with
and
his
face
was
bound
about
with
a
jesus
saith
unto
loose
and
let
him
then
many
of
the
jews
which
came
to
and
had
seen
the
things
which
jesus
believed
on
but
some
of
them
went
their
ways
to
the
and
told
them
what
things
jesus
had
then
gathered
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
a
and
what
do
for
this
man
doeth
many
if
we
let
him
thus
all
will
believe
on
and
the
romans
shall
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
and
one
of
being
the
high
priest
that
same
said
unto
ye
know
nothing
at
nor
consider
that
it
is
expedient
for
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
and
that
the
whole
nation
perish
and
this
spake
he
not
of
but
being
high
priest
that
he
prophesied
that
jesus
should
die
for
that
and
not
for
that
nation
but
that
also
he
should
gather
together
in
one
the
children
of
god
that
were
scattered
then
from
that
day
forth
they
took
counsel
together
for
to
put
him
to
jesus
therefore
walked
no
more
openly
among
the
but
went
thence
unto
a
country
near
to
the
into
a
city
called
and
there
continued
with
his
and
the
passover
was
nigh
at
and
many
went
out
of
the
country
up
to
jerusalem
before
the
to
purify
then
sought
they
for
and
spake
among
as
they
stood
in
the
what
think
that
he
will
not
come
to
the
now
both
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
had
given
a
if
any
man
knew
where
he
he
should
shew
that
they
might
take
chapter
then
jesus
six
days
before
the
passover
came
to
where
lazarus
was
which
had
been
whom
he
raised
from
the
there
they
made
him
a
and
martha
but
lazarus
was
one
of
them
that
sat
at
the
table
with
then
took
mary
a
pound
of
ointment
of
very
and
anointed
the
feet
of
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
the
then
saith
one
of
his
judas
which
should
betray
why
was
not
this
ointment
sold
for
three
hundred
and
given
to
the
this
he
not
that
he
cared
for
the
but
because
he
was
a
and
had
the
and
bare
what
was
put
then
said
let
her
against
the
day
of
my
burying
hath
she
kept
for
the
poor
always
ye
have
with
but
me
ye
have
not
much
people
of
the
jews
therefore
knew
that
he
was
and
they
came
not
for
sake
but
that
they
might
see
lazarus
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
but
the
chief
priests
consulted
that
they
might
put
lazarus
also
to
because
that
by
reason
of
him
many
of
the
jews
went
and
believed
on
on
the
next
day
much
people
that
were
come
to
the
when
they
heard
that
jesus
was
coming
to
took
branches
of
palm
and
went
forth
to
meet
and
blessed
the
king
of
israel
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
and
when
he
had
found
a
young
sat
as
it
is
fear
daughter
of
thy
king
sitting
on
an
these
things
understood
not
his
disciples
at
the
but
when
jesus
was
then
remembered
they
that
these
things
were
written
of
and
they
had
done
these
things
unto
the
people
therefore
that
was
with
him
when
he
called
lazarus
out
of
his
and
raised
him
from
the
bare
for
this
cause
the
people
also
met
for
that
they
heard
that
he
had
done
this
the
pharisees
therefore
said
among
perceive
ye
how
ye
prevail
the
world
is
gone
after
and
there
were
certain
greeks
among
them
that
came
up
to
worship
at
the
the
same
came
therefore
to
which
was
of
bethsaida
of
and
desired
we
would
see
philip
cometh
and
telleth
and
again
andrew
and
philip
tell
and
jesus
answered
the
hour
is
that
the
son
of
man
should
be
i
say
unto
except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
it
abideth
but
if
it
it
bringeth
forth
much
he
that
loveth
his
life
shall
lose
and
he
that
hateth
his
life
in
this
world
shall
keep
it
unto
life
if
any
man
serve
let
him
follow
and
where
i
there
shall
also
my
servant
if
any
man
serve
him
will
father
now
is
my
soul
and
what
shall
i
save
me
from
this
but
for
this
cause
came
i
unto
this
glorify
thy
then
came
there
a
voice
from
i
have
both
glorified
and
will
glorify
the
people
that
stood
and
heard
said
that
it
others
an
angel
spake
to
jesus
answered
and
this
voice
came
not
because
of
but
for
your
now
is
the
judgment
of
this
now
shall
the
prince
of
this
world
be
cast
and
if
i
be
lifted
up
from
the
will
draw
all
unto
this
he
signifying
what
death
he
should
the
people
answered
we
have
heard
out
of
the
law
that
christ
abideth
for
and
how
sayest
the
son
of
man
must
be
lifted
who
is
this
son
of
then
jesus
said
unto
yet
a
little
while
is
the
light
with
walk
while
ye
have
the
lest
darkness
come
upon
for
he
that
walketh
in
darkness
knoweth
not
whither
he
while
ye
have
believe
in
the
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
these
things
spake
and
and
did
hide
himself
from
but
though
he
had
done
so
many
miracles
before
yet
they
believed
not
on
that
the
saying
of
esaias
the
prophet
might
be
which
he
who
hath
believed
our
and
to
whom
hath
the
arm
of
the
lord
been
therefore
they
could
not
because
that
esaias
said
he
hath
blinded
their
and
hardened
their
that
they
should
not
see
with
nor
understand
with
and
be
and
i
should
heal
these
things
said
when
he
saw
his
and
spake
of
nevertheless
among
the
chief
rulers
also
many
believed
on
but
because
of
the
pharisees
they
did
not
confess
lest
they
should
be
put
out
of
the
for
they
loved
the
praise
of
men
more
than
the
praise
of
jesus
cried
and
he
that
believeth
on
believeth
not
on
but
on
him
that
sent
and
he
that
seeth
me
seeth
him
that
sent
i
am
come
a
light
into
the
that
whosoever
believeth
on
me
should
not
abide
in
and
if
any
man
hear
my
and
believe
i
judge
him
for
i
came
not
to
judge
the
but
to
save
the
he
that
rejecteth
and
receiveth
not
my
hath
one
that
judgeth
the
word
that
i
have
the
same
shall
judge
him
in
the
last
for
i
have
not
spoken
of
but
the
father
which
sent
he
gave
me
a
what
i
should
and
what
i
should
and
i
know
that
his
commandment
is
life
whatsoever
i
speak
even
as
the
father
said
unto
so
i
chapter
now
before
the
feast
of
the
when
jesus
knew
that
his
hour
was
come
that
he
should
depart
out
of
this
world
unto
the
having
loved
his
own
which
were
in
the
he
loved
them
unto
the
and
supper
being
the
devil
having
now
put
into
the
heart
of
judas
to
betray
jesus
knowing
that
the
father
had
given
all
things
into
his
and
that
he
was
come
from
and
went
to
he
riseth
from
and
laid
aside
his
and
took
a
and
girded
after
that
he
poureth
water
into
a
and
began
to
wash
the
and
to
wipe
with
the
towel
wherewith
he
was
then
cometh
he
to
simon
and
peter
saith
unto
dost
thou
wash
my
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
what
i
do
thou
knowest
not
but
thou
shalt
know
peter
saith
unto
thou
shalt
never
wash
my
jesus
answered
if
i
wash
thee
thou
hast
no
part
with
simon
peter
saith
unto
not
my
feet
but
also
hands
and
jesus
saith
to
he
that
is
washed
needeth
not
save
to
wash
but
is
clean
every
and
ye
are
but
not
for
he
knew
who
should
betray
therefore
said
ye
are
not
all
so
after
he
had
washed
their
and
had
taken
his
and
was
set
down
he
said
unto
know
ye
what
i
have
done
to
ye
call
me
master
and
and
ye
say
for
i
if
i
lord
and
have
washed
your
ye
also
ought
to
wash
one
for
i
have
given
you
an
that
ye
should
do
as
i
have
done
to
i
say
unto
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
neither
he
that
is
sent
greater
than
he
that
sent
if
ye
know
these
happy
are
ye
if
ye
do
i
speak
not
of
you
i
know
whom
i
have
but
that
the
scripture
may
be
he
that
eateth
bread
with
me
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
now
i
tell
you
before
it
when
it
is
come
to
ye
may
believe
that
i
am
i
say
unto
he
that
receiveth
whomsoever
i
send
receiveth
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
when
jesus
had
thus
he
was
troubled
in
and
and
i
say
unto
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
then
the
disciples
looked
one
on
doubting
of
whom
he
now
there
was
leaning
on
bosom
one
of
his
whom
jesus
simon
peter
therefore
beckoned
to
that
he
should
ask
who
it
should
be
of
whom
he
he
then
lying
on
breast
saith
unto
who
is
jesus
he
it
to
whom
i
shall
give
a
when
i
have
dipped
and
when
he
had
dipped
the
he
gave
to
judas
of
and
after
the
sop
satan
entered
into
then
said
jesus
unto
that
thou
do
now
no
man
at
the
table
knew
for
what
intent
he
spake
this
unto
for
some
because
judas
had
the
that
jesus
had
said
unto
buy
that
we
have
need
of
against
the
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
he
then
having
received
the
sop
went
immediately
and
it
was
when
he
was
gone
jesus
now
is
the
son
of
man
and
god

glorified
in
if

my
if
ye
have
love
one
to
simon
peter
said
unto
whither

jesus
answered

thou

peter
said
unto
why

spoken
unto
that
my
joy
might
remain
in
and
your
joy
might
be
this
is
my
that
ye
love
one
as
i
have
loved
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
ye
are
my
if
ye
do
whatsoever
i
command
henceforth
i
call
you
not
for
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
but
i
have
called
you
for
all
things
that
i
have
heard
of
my
father
i
have
made
known
unto
ye
have
not
chosen
but
i
have
chosen
and
ordained
that
ye
should
go
and
bring
forth
and
your
fruit
should
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
father
in
my
he
may
give
it
these
things
i
command
that
ye
love
one
if
the
world
hate
ye
know
that
it
hated
me
before
if
ye
were
of
the
the
world
would
love
his
but
because
ye
are
not
of
the
but
i
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
therefore
the
world
hateth
remember
the
word
that
i
said
unto
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
if
they
have
persecuted
they
will
also
persecute
if
they
have
kept
my
they
will
keep
but
all
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you
for
my
because
they
know
not
him
that
sent
if
i
had
not
come
and
spoken
unto
they
had
not
had
but
now
they
have
no
cloke
for
their
he
that
hateth
me
hateth
my
father
if
i
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
which
none
other
man
they
had
not
had
but
now
have
they
both
seen
and
hated
both
me
and
my
but
cometh
to
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
that
is
written
in
their
they
hated
me
without
a
but
when
the
comforter
is
whom
i
will
send
unto
you
from
the
the
spirit
of
which
proceedeth
from
the
he
shall
testify
of
and
ye
also
shall
bear
because
ye
have
been
with
me
from
the
chapter
these
things
have
i
spoken
unto
that
ye
should
not
be
they
shall
put
you
out
of
the
the
time
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
god
and
these
things
will
they
do
unto
because
they
have
not
known
the
nor
but
these
things
have
i
told
that
when
the
time
shall
ye
may
remember
that
i
told
you
of
and
these
things
i
said
not
unto
you
at
the
because
i
was
with
but
now
i
go
my
way
to
him
that
sent
and
none
of
you
asketh
whither
goest
but
because
i
have
said
these
things
unto
sorrow
hath
filled
your
nevertheless
i
tell
you
the
it
is
expedient
for
you
that
i
go
for
if
i
go
not
the
comforter
will
not
come
unto
but
if
i
i
will
send
him
unto
and
when
he
is
he
will
reprove
the
world
of
and
of
and
of
of
because
they
believe
not
on
of
because
i
go
to
my
and
ye
see
me
no
of
because
the
prince
of
this
world
is
i
have
yet
many
things
to
say
unto
but
ye
cannot
bear
them
howbeit
when
the
spirit
of
is
he
will
guide
you
into
all
for
he
shall
not
speak
of
but
whatsoever
he
shall
shall
he
and
he
will
shew
you
things
to
he
shall
glorify
for
he
shall
receive
of
and
shall
shew
unto
all
things
that
the
father
hath
are
therefore
said
that
he
shall
take
of
and
shall
shew
unto
a
little
and
ye
shall
not
see
and
a
little
and
ye
shall
see
because
i
go
to
the
then
said
of
his
disciples
among
what
is
this
that
he
saith
unto
a
little
and
ye
shall
not
see
and
a
little
and
ye
shall
see
because
i
go
to
the
they
said
what
is
this
that
he
a
little
we
cannot
tell
what
he
now
jesus
knew
that
they
were
desirous
to
ask
and
said
unto
do
ye
enquire
among
yourselves
of
that
i
a
little
and
ye
shall
not
see
and
a
little
and
ye
shall
see
i
say
unto
that
ye
shall
weep
and
but
the
world
shall
and
ye
shall
be
but
your
sorrow
shall
be
turned
into
a
woman
when
she
is
in
travail
hath
because
her
hour
is
but
as
soon
as
she
is
delivered
of
the
she
remembereth
no
more
the
for
joy
that
a
man
is
born
into
the
and
ye
now
therefore
have
but
i
will
see
you
and
your
heart
shall
and
your
joy
no
man
taketh
from
and
in
that
day
ye
shall
ask
me
i
say
unto
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
he
will
give
hitherto
have
ye
asked
nothing
in
my
and
ye
shall
that
your
joy
may
be
these
things
have
i
spoken
unto
you
in
but
the
time
when
i
shall
no
more
speak
unto
you
in
but
i
shall
shew
you
plainly
of
the
at
that
day
ye
shall
ask
in
my
and
i
say
not
unto
that
i
will
pray
the
father
for
for
the
father
himself
loveth
because
ye
have
loved
and
have
believed
that
i
came
out
from
i
came
forth
from
the
and
am
come
into
the
i
leave
the
and
go
to
the
his
disciples
said
unto
now
speakest
thou
and
speakest
no
now
are
we
sure
that
thou
knowest
all
and
needest
not
that
any
man
should
ask
by
this
we
believe
that
thou
camest
forth
from
jesus
answered
do
ye
now
the
hour
is
now
that
ye
shall
be
every
man
to
his
and
shall
leave
me
and
yet
i
am
not
because
the
father
is
with
these
things
i
have
spoken
unto
that
in
me
ye
might
have
in
the
world
ye
shall
have
but
be
of
good
i
have
overcome
the
chapter
these
words
spake
and
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
and
the
hour
is
glorify
thy
that
thy
son
also
may
glorify
as
thou
hast
given
him
power
over
all
that
he
should
give
eternal
life
to
as
many
as
thou
hast
given
and
this
is
life
that
they
might
know
thee
the
only
true
and
jesus
whom
thou
hast
i
have
glorified
thee
on
the
i
have
finished
the
work
which
thou
gavest
me
to
and
o
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
thee
before
the
world
i
have
manifested
thy
name
unto
the
men
which
thou
gavest
me
out
of
the
thine
they
and
thou
gavest
them
and
they
have
kept
thy
now
they
have
known
that
all
things
whatsoever
thou
hast
given
me
are
of
for
i
have
given
unto
them
the
words
which
thou
gavest
and
they
have
received
and
have
known
surely
that
i
came
out
from
and
they
have
believed
that
thou
didst
send
i
pray
for
i
pray
not
for
the
but
for
them
which
thou
hast
given
for
they
are
and
all
mine
are
and
thine
are
and
i
am
glorified
in
and
now
i
am
no
more
in
the
but
these
are
in
the
and
i
come
to
holy
keep
through
thine
own
name
those
whom
thou
hast
given
that
they
may
be
as
we
while
i
was
with
them
in
the
i
kept
them
in
thy
those
that
thou
gavest
me
i
have
and
none
of
them
is
but
the
son
of
that
the
scripture
might
be
and
now
come
i
to
and
these
things
i
speak
in
the
that
they
might
have
my
joy
fulfilled
in
i
have
given
them
thy
and
the
world
hath
hated
because
they
are
not
of
the
even
as
i
am
not
of
the
i
pray
not
that
thou
shouldest
take
them
out
of
the
but
that
thou
shouldest
keep
them
from
the

are
not
of
the

as
i
am
not
of
the
sanctify
them
through
thy
thy
word
is
as
thou
hast
sent
me
into
the
even
so
have
i
also
sent
them
into
the
and
for
their
sakes
i
sanctify
that
they
also
might
be
sanctified
through
the
neither
pray
i
for
these
but
for
them
also
which
shall
believe
on
me
through
their
that
they
all
may
be
as
in
and
i
in
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
that
the
world
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
and
the
glory
which
thou
gavest
me
i
have
given
that
they
may
be
even
as
we
are
i
in
and
thou
in
that
they
may
be
made
perfect
in
and
that
the
world
may
know
that
thou
hast
sent
and
hast
loved
as
thou
hast
loved
i
will
that
they
whom
thou
hast
given
be
with
me
where
i
that
they
may
behold
my
which
thou
hast
given
for
thou
lovedst
me
before
the
foundation
of
the
o
righteous
the
world
hath
not
known
but
i
have
known
and
these
have
known
that
thou
hast
sent
and
i
have
declared
unto
them
thy
and
will
declare
that
the
love
wherewith
thou
hast
loved
me
may
be
in
and
i
in

and
the
captain
and
officers
of
the
jews

led
him
away
to
annas
for
he

same
now

counsel
to
the
that
it
was
expedient
that
one
man
should
die
for

and
simon
peter
followed
and
another
that
disciple
was
known
unto
the
high
and
went
in
with
jesus
into
the
palace
of
the
high
but
peter
stood
at
the
door
then
went
out
that
other
which
was
known
unto
the
high
and
spake
unto
her
that
kept
the
and
brought
in
then
saith
the
damsel
that
kept
the
door
unto

also
of
this
he
i
am
and
the
servants
and
officers
stood
who
had
made
a
fire
of
for
it
was
and
they
warmed
and
peter
stood
with
and
warmed
the
high
priest
then
asked
jesus
of
his
and
of
his
jesus
answered
i
spake
openly
to
the
i
ever
taught
in
the
and
in
the
whither
the
jews
always
and
in
secret
have
i
said
why
askest
thou
ask
them
which
heard
what
i
have
said
unto
they
know
what
i
and
when
he
had
thus
one
of
the
officers
which
stood
by
struck
jesus
with
the
palm
of
his
answerest
thou
the
high
priest
jesus
answered
if
i
have
spoken
bear
witness
of
the
but
if
why
smitest
thou
now
annas
had
sent
him
bound
unto
caiaphas
the
high
and
simon
peter
stood
and
warmed
they
said
therefore
unto

thou
also
of
his
he
denied
and
i
am
one
of
the
servants
of
the
high
being
kinsman
whose
ear
peter
cut
did
not
i
see

in
the
garden
with
peter
then
denied
and
immediately
the
cock
then
led
they
jesus
from
caiaphas
unto
the
hall
of
and
it
was
and
they
themselves
went
not
into
the
judgment
lest
they
should
be
but
that
they
might
eat
the
pilate
then
went
out
unto
and
what
accusation

ye
against
this
they
answered
and
said
unto
if
he
were
not
a
we
would
not
have
delivered
him
up
unto
then
said
pilate
unto
take
ye
and
judge
him
according
to
your
the
jews
therefore
said
unto
it

not
lawful
for
us
to
put
any
man
to
that
the
saying
of
jesus
might
be
which
he
signifying

priests
have
delivered
thee
unto
what
hast
thou
jesus
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
if
my
kingdom
were
of

then
would
my
servants
that
i
should
not
be
delivered
to
the
but
now
is
my
kingdom
not
from
pilate
therefore
said
unto
art
thou
a
king
jesus
thou
sayest
that
i
am
a
to
this
end
was
i
and
for
this
cause
came
i
into
the
that
i
should
bear
witness
unto
the
every
one
that
is
of
the
truth
heareth
my
pilate
saith
unto
what

and
when
he
had
said
he
went
out
again
unto
the

saith
unto

find
in
him
no
fault
but

therefore
heard
that
he
was
the
more

went
again
into
the

from
thenceforth
pilate
sought
to
release

the
jews
cried

might
be
which
they
parted
my
raiment
among
and
for
my

therefore
had
received
the

they
brake
not
his

one
of
the
soldiers
with
a
spear
pierced
his

forthwith
came
there
out

and
he
that
saw

knoweth
that

these
things
were
that

side
of

now
they
were
not
able

for
the
multitude
of
therefore
that
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
saith
unto
it
is
the
now
when
simon
peter
heard
that
it
was
the
he
girt

was
and
did
cast
himself
into

a
little
they

not
far
from
but
as
it
were
two
hundred
dragging
the
net
with
as
soon
then
as
they
were
come
to

saw
a
fire
of
coals
and
fish

and
jesus
saith
unto

of
the
fish
which
ye
have
now
simon

went
and
drew
the
net
to
land
full
of
great
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
and
for
all
there
were
so
yet

net
jesus
saith
unto
come
and
none
of
the
disciples
durst
ask
who
art
knowing
that
it
was
the
jesus
then
and
taketh
and
giveth
and
fish
this
is
now
the
third
time
that
jesus
shewed
himself
to
his
after
that
he
was
risen
from
the
so
when
they
had
jesus
saith
to
simon
of
lovest
thou
me
more
than
he
saith
unto
thou
knowest
that
i
love
he
saith
unto
feed
my
he
saith
to
him
again
the
second
of
lovest
thou
he
saith
unto
thou
knowest
that
i
love
he
saith
unto
feed
my
he
saith
unto
him
the
third
of
lovest
thou
peter
was
grieved
because
he
said
unto
him
the
third
lovest
thou
and
he
said
unto
thou
knowest
all
thou
knowest
that
i
love
jesus
saith
unto
feed
my
i
say
unto
when
thou
wast
thou
girdedst
and
walkedst
whither
thou
but
when
thou
shalt
be
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thy
and
another
shall
gird
and
carry
whither
thou
wouldest
this
spake
signifying
by
what
death
he
should
glorify
and
when
he
had
spoken
he
saith
unto
follow
then
turning
seeth
the
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
which
also
leaned
on
his
breast
at
and
which
is
he
that
betrayeth
peter
seeing
him
saith
to
and
what
this
man
jesus
saith
unto
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
what
to
follow
thou
then
went
this
saying
abroad
among
the
that
that
disciple
should
not
yet
jesus
said
not
unto
he
shall
not
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
what
to
this
is
the
disciple
which
testifieth
of
these
and
wrote
these
and
we
know
that
his
testimony
is
and
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
jesus
the
if
they
should
be
written
every
i
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
the
books
that
should
be
the
acts
of
the
apostles
chapter
the
former
treatise
have
i
o
of
all
that
jesus
began
both
to
do
and
until
the
day
in
which
he
was
taken
after
that
he
through
the
holy
ghost
had
given
commandments
unto
the
apostles
whom
he
had
to
whom
also
he
shewed
himself
alive
after
his
passion
by
many
infallible
being
seen
of
them
forty
and
speaking
of
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
being
assembled
together
with
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
depart
from
but
wait
for
the
promise
of
the
ye
have
heard
of
for
john
truly
baptized
with
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
ghost
not
many
days
when
they
therefore
were
come
they
asked
of
wilt
thou
at
this
time
restore
again
the
kingdom
to
and
he
said
unto
it
is
not
for
you
to
know
the
times
or
the
which
the
father
hath
put
in
his
own
but
ye
shall
receive
after
that
the
holy
ghost
is
come
upon
and
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
both
in
and
in
all
and
in
and
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
and
when
he
had
spoken
these
while
they
he
was
taken
and
a
cloud
received
him
out
of
their
and
while
they
looked
stedfastly
toward
heaven
as
he
went
two
men
stood
by
them
in
white
which
also
ye
men
of
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
this
same
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
then
returned
they
unto
jerusalem
from
the
mount
called
which
is
from
jerusalem
a
sabbath
and
when
they
were

they
went
up
into
an
upper

abode
both
and
and
and

with
one
accord
in
prayer
and
with
the

mary
the
mother
of
and
with
his
and
in
those
days
peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
and
number
of
names
together
were
about
an
hundred
and
men
this
scripture
must
needs
have
been

the
holy
ghost
by
the
mouth
of
david
spake
before
concerning
which
was

to
them

was
numbered
with
and
had
obtained
part
of
this

purchased
a
field
with
the
reward
of
and
falling

burst
asunder
in
the
and
all
his
bowels
gushed
and
it
was
known
unto
all
the
dwellers
at
insomuch
as
that
field
is
called
in
their
proper
that
is
to
the
field
of

it
is
written
in
the
book
of
let
his
habitation
be
and
let
no
man
dwell
and
his
bishoprick
let

wherefore
of
these
men
which
have
companied
with
us
all
the
time
that
the
lord
jesus
went
in
and
out
among
beginning
from
the
baptism
of
unto
that
same
day
that
he
was
taken
up
from

one
be
ordained
to
be
a
witness
with
us
of
his
and
they
appointed
joseph

who
was
surnamed

and
they
and
which
knowest
the
hearts
of
all

whether
of
these
two
thou
hast
that
he
may
take
part
of
this
ministry

from
which
judas
by
transgression
that
he
might
go
to
his
own
and
they
gave
forth
their
and
the
lot
fell
upon
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
eleven
chapter
and
when
the
day
of
pentecost
was
fully
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
one
and
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
from
heaven
as
of
a
rushing
mighty
and
it
filled
all
the
house
where
they
were
and
there
appeared
unto
them
cloven
tongues
like
as
of
and
it
sat
upon
each
of
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
and
began
to
speak
with
other
as
the
spirit
gave
them
and
there
were
dwelling
at
jerusalem
devout
out
of
every
nation
under
now
when
this
was
noised
the
multitude
came
and
were
because
that
every
man
heard
them
speak
in
his
own
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
saying
one
to

not
all
these
which
speak
and
how
hear
we
every
man
in
our

in
the
parts
of

and
we
do
hear
them

in
our
tongues

they
were
all
and
were
in
saying
one
to
what

full
of
new

by
the
prophet

by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
ye
have
and
by
wicked
hands
have
crucified
and
whom
god
hath
raised
having
loosed
the
pains
of
because
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
for
david
speaketh
concerning
i
foresaw
the
lord
always
before
my
for
he
is
on
my
right
that
i
should
not
be
therefore
did
my
heart
and
my
tongue
was
moreover

my
flesh
shall
rest
in

wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
neither
wilt
thou
suffer
thine
holy
one

hast
made
known

ways
of
thou
shalt
make
me
full
of
joy
with
thy
men

me
freely
speak
unto
you
of
the
patriarch
that
he
is
both
dead
and
and
his
sepulchre
is
with
us
unto
this
therefore
being
a
and
knowing
that
god
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
that
of
the
fruit
of
his
according
to
the
he
would
raise
up
christ
to
sit
on
his
he
seeing
this
before
spake
of
the
resurrection
of
that
his
soul
was
not
left
in
neither
his
flesh
did
see
this
jesus
hath
god
raised
whereof
we
all
are
therefore
being
by
the
right
hand
of
god
and
having
received
of
the
father
the
promise
of
the
holy
he
hath
shed
forth
which
ye
now
see
and
for
david
is
not
ascended
into
the
but
he
saith
the
lord

a
certain
man
lame
from

they
laid
daily
at

seeing
peter
and
john
about
to
go
into
the
temple
asked
an

fastening
his
eyes
upon
him
with
look
on
and
he
gave
heed
unto
expecting
to
receive
something
of

have
i
but
such
as
i
have
give
i
in
the
name
of
jesus

rise
up

and
he
took
him
by
the
right
and
lifted
and
immediately
his
feet
and
ancle
bones
received
and
he
leaping
up
and
and
entered
with
them
into
the

and
praising
and
all
the
people
saw
him
walking
and
praising
and
they
knew
that
it
was
he
which
sat
for
alms
at
the
beautiful
gate
of
the
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
amazement
at
that
which
had
happened
unto
and
as
the
lame
man
which
was
healed
held
peter
and
all
the
people
ran
together
unto
them
in
the
porch
that
is
called
greatly
and
when
peter
saw
he
answered
unto
the
ye
men
of
why
marvel
ye
at
or
why
look
ye
so
earnestly
on
as
though
by
our
own
power
or
holiness
we
had
made
this
man
to
the
god
of
and
of
and
of
the
god
of
our
hath
glorified
his
son
whom
ye
delivered
and
denied
him
in
the
presence
of
when
he
was
determined
to
let
but
ye
denied
the
holy
one
and
the
and
desired
a
murderer
to
be
granted
unto
and
killed
the
prince
of
whom
god
hath
raised
from
the
whereof
we
are
and
his
name
through
faith
in
his
name
hath
made
this
man
whom
ye
see
and
the
faith
which
is
by
him
hath
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
in
the
presence
of
you
and
i
wot
that
through
ignorance
ye
did
as
also
your
but
those
which
god
before
had
shewed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
that
christ
should
he
hath
so
repent
ye
and
be
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
when
the
times
of
refreshing
shall
come
from
the
presence
of
the
and
he
shall
send
jesus
which
before
was
preached
unto
whom
the
heaven
must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
which
god
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
for
moses
truly
said
unto
the
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
like
unto
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
and
it
shall
come
to
every
which
will
not
hear
that
shall
be
destroyed
from
among
the
and
all
the
prophets
from
samuel
and
those
that
follow
as
many
as
have
have
likewise
foretold
of
these
ye
are
the
children
of
the
and
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
our
saying
unto
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
unto
you
first
having
raised
up
his
son
sent
him
to
bless
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
chapter
and
as
they
spake
unto
the
the
and
the
captain
of
the
and
the
came
upon
being
grieved
that
they
taught
the
and
preached
through
jesus
the
resurrection
from
the
and
they
laid
hands
on
and
put
in
hold
unto
the
next
for
it
was
now
howbeit
many
of
them
which
heard
the
word
and
the
number
of
the
men
was
about
five
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
their
and
and
and
annas
the
high
and
and
and
and
as
many
as
were
of
the
kindred
of
the
high
were
gathered
together
at
and
when
they
had
set
them
in
the
they
by
what
or
by
what
have
ye
done
then
filled
with
the
holy
said
unto
ye
rulers
of
the
and
elders
of
if
we
this
day
be
examined
of
the
good
deed
done
to
the
impotent
by
what
means
he
is
made
be
it
known
unto
you
and
to
all
the
people
of
that
by
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
whom
ye
whom
god
raised
from
the
by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
this
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
nought
of
you
which
is
become
the
head
of
the
neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
whereby
we
must
be
now
when
they
saw
the
boldness
of
peter
and
and
perceived
that
they
were
unlearned
and
ignorant
they
and
they
took
knowledge
of
that
they
had
been
with
and
beholding
the
man
which
was
healed
standing
with
they
could
say
nothing
against
but
when
they
had
commanded
them
to
go
aside
out
of
the
they
conferred
among
what
shall
we
do
to
these
for
that
indeed
a
notable
miracle
hath
been
done
by
them
manifest
to
all
them
that
dwell
in
and
we
cannot
deny
but
that
it
spread
no
further
among
the
let
us
straitly
threaten
that
they
speak
henceforth
to
no
man
in
this
and
they
called
and
commanded
them
not
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
but
peter
and
john
answered
and
said
unto
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
judge
for
we
cannot
but
speak
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
so
when
they
had
further
threatened
they
let
them
finding
nothing
how
they
might
punish
because
of
the
for
all
glorified
god
for
that
which
was
for
the
man
was
above
forty
years
on
whom
this
miracle
of
healing
was
and
being
let
they
went
to
their
own
and
reported
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
elders
had
said
unto
and
when
they
heard
they
lifted
up
their
voice
to
god
with
one
and
thou
which
hast
made
and
and
the
and
all
that
in
them
who
by
the
mouth
of
thy
servant
david
hast
why
did
the
heathen
and
the
people
imagine
vain
the
kings
of
the
earth
stood
and
the
rulers
were
gathered
together
against
the
and
against
his
for
of
a
truth
against
thy
holy
child
whom
thou
hast
both
and
pontius
with
the
and
the
people
of
were
gathered
for
to
do
whatsoever
thy
hand
and
thy
counsel
determined
before
to
be
and
behold
their
and
grant
unto
thy
that
with
all
boldness
they
may
speak
thy
by
stretching
forth
thine
hand
to
and
that
signs
and
wonders
may
be
done
by
the
name
of
thy
holy
child
and
when
they
had
the
place
was
shaken
where
they
were
assembled
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
and
they
spake
the
word
of
god
with
and
the
multitude
of
them
that
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
neither
said
any
that
ought
of
the
things
which
he
possessed
was
his
but
they
had
all
things
and
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
resurrection
of
the
lord
and
great
grace
was
upon
them
neither
was
there
any
among
them
that
for
as
many
as
were
possessors
of
lands
or
houses
sold
and
brought
the
prices
of
the
things
that
were
and
laid
down
at
the
and
distribution
was
made
unto
every
man
according
as
he
had
and
who
by
the
apostles
was
surnamed
being
the
son
of
a
of
the
country
of
having
sold
and
brought
the
and
laid
at
the
chapter
but
a
certain
man
named
with
sapphira
his
sold
a
and
kept
back
of
the
his
wife
also
being
privy
and
brought
a
certain
and
laid
at
the
but
peter
why
hath
satan
filled
thine
heart
to
lie
to
the
holy
and
to
keep
back
of
the
price
of
the
whiles
it
was
it
not
thine
and
after
it
was
was
it
not
in
thine
own
why
hast
thou
conceived
this
thing
in
thine
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
but
unto
and
ananias
hearing
these
words
fell
and
gave
up
the
and
great
fear
came
on
all
them
that
heard
these
and
the
young
men
wound
him
and
carried
and
buried
and
it
was
about
the
space
of
three
hours
when
his
not
knowing
what
was
came
and
peter
answered
unto
tell
me
whether
ye
sold
the
land
for
so
and
she
for
so
then
peter
said
unto
how
is
it
that
ye
have
agreed
together
to
tempt
the
spirit
of
the
the
feet
of
them
which
have
buried
thy
husband
at
the
and
shall
carry
thee
then
fell
she
down
straightway
at
his
and
yielded
up
the
and
the
young
men
came
and
found
her
carrying
buried
by
her
and
great
fear
came
upon
all
the
and
upon
as
many
as
heard
these
and
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles
were
many
signs
and
wonders
wrought
among
the
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
and
of
the
rest
durst
no
man
join
himself
to
but
the
people
magnified
and
believers
were
the
more
added
to
the
multitudes
both
of
men
and
insomuch
that
they
brought
forth
the
sick
into
the
and
laid
on
beds
and
that
at
the
least
the
shadow
of
peter
passing
by
might
overshadow
some
of
there
came
also
a
multitude
of
the
cities
round
about
unto
bringing
sick
and
them
which
were
vexed
with
unclean
and
they
were
healed
every
then
the
high
priest
rose
and
all
they
that
were
with
is
the
sect
of
the
and
were
filled
with
and
laid
their
hands
on
the
and
put
them
in
the
common
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
by
night
opened
the
prison
and
brought
them
and
stand
and
speak
in
the
temple
to
the
people
all
the
words
of
this
and
when
they
heard
they
entered
into
the
temple
early
in
the
and
but
the
high
priest
and
they
that
were
with
and
called
the
council
and
all
the
senate
of
the
children
of
and
sent
to
the
prison
to
have
them
but
when
the
officers
and
found
them
not
in
the
they
and
the
prison
truly
found
we
shut
with
all
and
the
keepers
standing
without
before
the
but
when
we
had
we
found
no
man
now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
heard
these
they
doubted
of
them
whereunto
this
would
then
came
one
and
told
the
men
whom
ye
put
in
prison
are
standing
in
the
and
teaching
the
then
went
the
captain
with
the
and
brought
them
without
for
they
feared
the
lest
they
should
have
been
and
when
they
had
brought
they
set
before
the
and
the
high
priest
asked
did
not
we
straitly
command
you
that
ye
should
not
teach
in
this
ye
have
filled
jerusalem
with
your
and
intend
to
bring
this
blood
upon
then
peter
and
the
apostles
answered
and
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
the
god
of
our
fathers
raised
up
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
him
hath
god
exalted
with
his
right
hand
a
prince
and
a
for
to
give
repentance
to
and
forgiveness
of
and
we
are
his
witnesses
of
these
and
also
the
holy
whom
god
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
when
they
heard
they
were
cut
the
and
took
counsel
to
slay
then
stood
there
up
one
in
the
a
named
a
doctor
of
the
had
in
reputation
among
all
the
and
commanded
to
put
the
apostles
forth
a
little
and
said
unto
ye
men
of
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
for
before
these
days
rose
up
boasting
himself
to
be
to
whom
a
number
of
about
four
joined
who
was
and
as
many
as
obeyed
were
and
brought
to
after
this
man
rose
up
judas
of
galilee
in
the
days
of
the
and
drew
away
much
people
after
he
also
and
as
many
as
obeyed
were
and
now
i
say
unto
refrain
from
these
and
let
them
for
if
this
counsel
or
this
work
be
of
it
will
come
to
but
if
it
be
of
ye
cannot
overthrow
lest
haply
ye
be
found
even
to
fight
against
and
to
him
they
and
when
they
had
called
the
and
beaten
they
commanded
that
they
should
not
speak
in
the
name
of
and
let
them
and
they
departed
from
the
presence
of
the
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
and
daily
in
the
and
in
every
they
ceased
not
to
teach
and
preach
jesus
chapter
and
in
those
when
the
number
of
the
disciples
was
there
arose
a
murmuring
of
the
grecians
against
the
because
their
widows
were
neglected
in
the
daily
then
the
twelve
called
the
multitude
of
the
disciples
and
it
is
not
reason
that
we
should
leave
the
word
of
and
serve
look
ye
out
among
you
seven
men
of
honest
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
whom
we
may
appoint
over
this
but
we
will
give
ourselves
continually
to
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
and
the
saying
pleased
the
whole
and
they
chose
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
holy
and
and
and
and
and
and
nicolas
a
proselyte
of
whom
they
set
before
the
and
when
they
had
they
laid
hands
on
and
the
word
of
god
and
the
number
of
the
disciples
multiplied
in
jerusalem
and
a
great
company
of
the
priests
were
obedient
to
the
and
full
of
faith
and
did
great
wonders
and
miracles
among
the
then
there
arose
certain
of
the
which
is
called
of
the
and
and
and
of
them
of
cilicia
and
of
disputing
with
and
they
were
not
able
to
resist
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
by
which
he
then
they
suborned
which
we
have
heard
him
speak
blasphemous
words
against
and
and
they
stirred
up
the
and
the
and
the
and
came
upon
and
caught
and
brought
to
the
and
set
up
false
which
this
man
ceaseth
not
to
speak
blasphemous
words
against
this
holy
and
the
for
we
have
heard
him
that
this
jesus
of
nazareth
shall
destroy
this
and
shall
change
the
customs
which
moses
delivered
and
all
that
sat
in
the
looking
stedfastly
on
saw
his
face
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
chapter
then
said
the
high
are
these
things
and
he
and
the
god
of
glory
appeared
unto
our
father
when
he
was
in
before
he
dwelt
in
and
said
unto
get
thee
out
of
thy
and
from
thy
and
come
into
the
land
which
i
shall
shew
then
came
he
out
of
the
land
of
the
and
dwelt
in
and
from
when
his
father
was
he
removed
him
into
this
wherein
ye
now
and
he
gave
him
none
inheritance
in
not
much
to
set
his
foot
yet
he
promised

our
who
received
the
lively
oracles
to
give
unto
to
whom
our

would
not

in
their
hearts
turned

have
slain
them
which

ye
have
been
now
the
betrayers
and
who
have
received

have
not
kept
when
they
heard
these
they
were
cut
to
the
and
they
gnashed
on
him
with
but
being
full
of
the
holy
looked
up
stedfastly
into
and
saw
the
glory
of
and
jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
and
i
see
the
heavens
and
the
son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of

they
cried
out
with
a
loud
and
stopped
their
and
ran
upon
him
with
one
and
cast
out
of
the
and
stoned
and
the
witnesses
laid
down
their
clothes
at
a
young
whose
name
was
and
they
stoned
calling
upon
and
lord
receive
my
and
he
kneeled
and
cried
with
a
loud
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
and
when
he
had
said
he
fell
chapter
and
saul
was
consenting
unto
his
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
great
persecution
against
the
church
which
was
at
and
they
were
all
scattered
abroad
throughout
the
regions
of
judaea
and
except
the
and
devout
men
carried
stephen
his
and
made
great
lamentation
over
as
for
he
made
havock
of
the
entering
into
every
and
haling
men
and
women
committed
to
therefore
they
that
were
scattered
abroad
went
every
where
preaching
the
then
philip
went
down
to
the
city
of
and
preached
christ
unto
and
the
people
with
one
accord
gave
heed
unto
those
things
which
philip
hearing
and
seeing
the
miracles
which
he
for
unclean
crying
with
loud
came
out
of
many
that
were
possessed
and
many
taken
with
and
that
were
were
and
there
was
great
joy
in
that
but
there
was
a
certain
called
which
beforetime
in
the
same
city
used
and
bewitched
the
people
of
giving
out
that
himself
was
some
great
to
whom
they
all
gave
from
the
least
to
the
this
man
is
the
great
power
of
and
to
him
they
had
because
that
of
long
time
he
had
bewitched
them
with
but
when
they
believed
philip
preaching
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
and
the
name
of
jesus
they
were
both
men
and
then
simon
himself
believed
and
when
he
was
he
continued
with
and
beholding
the
miracles
and
signs
which
were
now
when
the
apostles
which
were
at
jerusalem
heard
that
samaria
had
received
the
word
of
they
sent
unto
them
peter
and
when
they
were
come
prayed
for
that
they
might
receive
the
holy
as
yet
he
was
fallen
upon
none
of
only
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
then
laid
they
hands
on
and
they
received
the
holy
and
when
simon
saw
that
through
laying
on
of
the
hands
the
holy
ghost
was
he
offered
them
give
me
also
this
that
on
whomsoever
i
lay
he
may
receive
the
holy
but
peter
said
unto
thy
money
perish
with
because
thou
hast
thought
that
the
gift
of
god
may
be
purchased
with
thou
hast
neither
part
nor
lot
in
this
for
thy
heart
is
not
right
in
the
sight
of
repent
therefore
of
this
thy
and
pray
if
perhaps
the
thought
of
thine
heart
may
be
forgiven
for
i
perceive
that
thou
art
in
the
gall
of
and
the
bond
of

answered
and
pray
ye
to
the
lord
for
that

which
he
had
seen

sent
from
cornelius
had
made
enquiry
for

stood
before

thought
on
the
the
spirit
said
unto
three
men
seek

and
get
thee
and

with
doubting
for
i
have

peter
went
down
to
the
men
which
were
sent
unto
him
from
and
i
am
he
whom
ye
what
the
cause
wherefore
ye
are
and
they
cornelius
the
a
just
and
one
that
feareth
and
of
good
report
among
all
the
nation
of
the
was
warned
from

by
an
holy

on

certain
brethren
from

accompanied
and
the
morrow
after
they
entered
into
and
cornelius
waited
for
and
had
called
together
his
kinsmen
and
near
and
as
peter
was
coming
cornelius
met
and
fell
down
at
his
and
worshipped
but
peter
took
him
stand
i
myself
also
am
a
and
as
he
talked
with
he
went
and
found
many
that
were
come
and
he
said
unto
ye
know
how
that
it
is
an
unlawful
thing
for
a
man
that
is
a
jew
to
keep
or
come
unto
one
of
another
but
god
hath
shewed
me
that
i
should
not
call
any
man
common
or
therefore
came
i
without
as
soon
as
i
was
sent
i
ask
therefore
for
what
intent
ye
have
sent
for
and
cornelius
four
days
ago
i
was
fasting
until
this
and
at
the
ninth
hour
i
prayed
in
my
a
man

before
me
in
bright
and
thy
prayer
is
and
thine
alms
are
had
in
remembrance
in
the
sight
of
send
therefore
to

the
house
of
simon
a
tanner
by
the
sea
when
he
shall
speak
unto
immediately
therefore
i
sent
to
and
thou
hast
well
done
that
thou
art
now
therefore
are
we
all
here
present
before
to
hear
all
things
that
are
commanded
thee
of
then
peter
opened
and
of
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
but
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
and
worketh
is
accepted
with
the
word
which
sent
unto
the
children
of
preaching
peace
by
jesus
is
lord
of
that
ye
which
was
published
throughout
all
and
began
from
after
the
baptism
which
john
how
god
anointed
jesus
of
nazareth
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
who
went
about
doing
and
healing
all
that
were
oppressed
of
the
for
god
was
with
and
we
are
witnesses
of
all
things
which
he
did
both
in
the
land
of
the
and
in
whom
they
slew
and
hanged
on
a
him
god
raised
up
the
third
and
shewed
him
not
to
all
the
but
unto
witnesses
chosen
before
of
to
who
did
eat
and
drink
with
him
after
he
rose
from
the
and
he
commanded
us
to
preach
unto
the
and
to
testify
that
it
is
he
which
was
ordained
of
god
the
judge
of
quick
and
to
him
give
all
the
prophets
that
through
his
name
whosoever
believeth
in
him
shall
receive
remission
of
while
peter
yet
spake
these
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
and
they
of
the
circumcision
which
believed
were
as
many
as
came
with
because
that
on
the
gentiles
also
was
poured
out
the
gift
of
the
holy
for
they
heard
them
speak
with
and
magnify
then
answered
can
any
man
forbid
that
these
should
not
be
which
have
received
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
and
he
commanded
them
to
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
then
prayed
they
him
to
tarry
certain
chapter
and
the
apostles
and
brethren
that
were
in
judaea
heard
that
the
gentiles
had
also
received
the
word
of
and
when
peter
was
come
up
to
they
that
were
of
the
circumcision
contended
with
thou
wentest
in
to
men
and
didst
eat
with
but
peter
rehearsed
from
the
and
expounded
by
order
unto
i
was
in
the
city
of
joppa
and
in
a
trance
i
saw
a
a
certain
vessel
as
it
had
been
a
great
let
down
from
heaven
by
four
and
it
came
even
to
upon
the
which
when
i
had
fastened
mine
i
and
saw
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
and
wild
and
creeping
and
fowls
of
the
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
slay
and
but
i
not
for
nothing
common
or
unclean
hath
at
any
time
entered
into
my
but
the
voice
answered
me
again
from
what
god
hath
call
not
thou
and
this
was
done
three
and
all
were
drawn
up
again
into
immediately
there
were
three
men
already
come
unto
the
house
where
i
sent
from
caesarea
unto
and
the
spirit
bade
me
go
with
nothing
moreover
these
six
brethren
accompanied
and
we
entered
into
the
and
he
shewed
us
how
he
had
seen
an
angel
in
his
which
stood
and
said
unto
send
men
to
and
call
for
whose
surname
is
who
shall
tell
thee
whereby
thou
and
all
thy
house
shall
be
and
as
i
began
to
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
as
on
us
at
the
then
remembered
i
the
word
of
the
how
that
he
john
indeed
baptized
with
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
forasmuch
then
as
god
gave
them
the
like
gift
as
unto
who
believed
on
the
lord
jesus
what
was
that
i
could
withstand
when
they
heard
these
they
held
their
and
glorified
then
hath
god
also
to
the
gentiles
granted
repentance
unto
now
they
which
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
persecution
that
arose
about
stephen
travelled
as
far
as
and
and
preaching
the
word
to
none
but
unto
the
jews
and
some
of
them
were
men
of
cyprus
and
when
they
were
come
to
spake
unto
the
preaching
the
lord
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
with
and
a
great
number
and
turned
unto
the
then
tidings
of
these
things
came
unto
the
ears
of
the
church
which
was
in
and
they
sent
forth
that
he
should
go
as
far
as
when
he
and
had
seen
the
grace
of
was
and
exhorted
them
that
with
purpose
of
heart
they
would
cleave
unto
the
for
he
was
a
good
and
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
of
and
much
people
was
added
unto
the
then
departed
barnabas
to
for
to
seek
and
when
he
had
found
he
brought
him
unto
and
it
came
to
that
a
whole
year
they
assembled
themselves
with
the
and
taught
much
and
the
disciples
were
called
christians
first
in
and
in
these
days
came
prophets
from
jerusalem
unto
and
there
stood
up
one
of
them
named
and
signified
by
the
spirit
that
there
should
be
great
dearth
throughout
all
the
which
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
claudius
then
the
every
man
according
to
his
determined
to
send
relief
unto
the
brethren
which
dwelt
in
which
also
they
and
sent
it
to
the
elders
by
the
hands
of
barnabas
and
chapter
now
about
that
time
herod
the
king
stretched
forth
hands
to
vex
certain
of
the
and
he
killed
james
the
brother
of
john
with
the
and
because
he
saw
it
pleased
the
he
proceeded
further
to
take
peter
were
the
days
of
unleavened
and
when
he
had
apprehended
he
put
in
and
delivered
to
four
quaternions
of
soldiers
to
keep
intending
after
easter
to
bring
him
forth
to
the
peter
therefore
was
kept
in
but
prayer
was
made
without
ceasing
of
the
church
unto
god
for
and
when
herod
would
have
brought
him
the
same
night
peter
was
sleeping
between
two
bound
with
two
and
the
keepers
before
the
door
kept
the
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
upon
and
a
light
shined
in
the
and
he
smote
peter
on
the
and
raised
him
arise
up
and
his
chains
fell
off
from

the
angel
said
unto
gird
and
bind
on
thy
and
so
he
and
he
saith
unto
cast
thy
garment
about
and
follow
and
he
went
and
followed
and
wist
not
that
it
was
true
which
was
done
by
the
but
thought
he
saw
a
when
they
were
past
the
first
and
the
second
they
came
unto
the
iron
gate
that
leadeth
unto
the
which
opened
to
them
of
his
own
and
they
went
and
passed
on
through
one
and
forthwith
the
angel
departed
from
and
when
peter
was
come
to
he
now
i
know
of
a
that
the
lord
hath
sent
his
and
hath
delivered
me
out
of
the
hand
of
and
all
the
expectation
of
the
people
of
the
and
when
he
had
considered
he
came
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
whose
surname
was
where
many
were
gathered
together
and
as
peter
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
a
damsel
came
to
named
and
when
she
knew
she
opened
not
the
gate
for
but
ran
and
told
how
peter
stood
before
the
and
they
said
unto
thou
art
but
she
constantly
affirmed
that
it
was
even
then
said
it
is
his
but
peter
continued
and
when
they
had
opened
and
saw
they
were
but
beckoning
unto
them
with
the
hand
to
hold
their
declared
unto
them
how
the
lord
had
brought
him
out
of

he
go

these
things
unto

he
and
went
into
another

as
soon
as
it
was
there
was
no
small
stir
among
the
what
was
become
of
and
when
herod
had
sought
for
and
found
him
he
examined
the
and
commanded
that

be
put
to
and
he
went
down
from
judaea
to
and
and
herod
was
highly
displeased
with
them
of

and
but
they
came
with
one
accord
to
having
made

mist
and
a
and
he
went
about
seeking
some
to
lead
him
by
the

when
he
saw
what

as
strangers
in
the
land
of
and
with
an
high
arm
brought

them
out
of

about
the
time
of
forty
years
suffered
he
their
manners
in
the
and
when
he
had
destroyed
seven
nations
in
the
land
of
he
divided
their
land
to
them
by
and
after

when

he
whom
think

i
am
not
there
cometh
one
after
whose
shoes
of
feet
i
am
not
worthy
to
men
children
of
the
stock
of
and
whosoever
among

feareth
to
you
is
the
word
of
this
salvation

their
because
they
knew
him
nor
yet
the
voices
of
the
prophets
which
are
read
every
sabbath
they
have
fulfilled
in
condemning
and
though
they
found
no
cause
of
death
yet
desired
they
pilate
that
he
should
be
and
when
they
had
fulfilled
all
that
was
written
of
they
took

up
with
him
from

unto
the
god

of

he
saith
also
in
another

shalt

for
after
he

served
his
own
generation
by
the

and
by

that

from

a
work
which
ye
shall
in
no

though
a
man
declare
it
unto
and
when
the
jews
were
gone
out
of
the
the
gentiles
besought
that
these
words
might
be
preached
to
them
the
next
now
when
the
congregation
was
broken
many
of
the
jews
and
religious
proselytes
followed
paul
and
speaking
to
persuaded
them
to
continue
in
the
grace
of
and
the
next
sabbath
day
came
almost
the
whole
city
together
to
hear
the
word
of
but
when
the
jews
saw
the
they
were
filled
with
and
spake
against
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
contradicting
and
then
paul
and
barnabas
waxed
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
word
of
god
should
first
have
been
spoken
to
but
seeing
ye
put
it
from
and
judge
yourselves
unworthy
of
everlasting
we
turn
to
the
for
so
hath
the
lord
commanded
i
have
set
thee
to
be
a
light
of
the
that
thou
shouldest
be
for
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
and
when
the
gentiles
heard
they
were
and
glorified
the
word
of
the
and
as
many
as
were
ordained
to
eternal
life
and
the
word
of
the
lord
was
published
throughout
all
the
but
the
jews
stirred
up
the
devout
and
honourable
and
the
chief
men
of
the
and
raised
persecution
against
paul
and
and
expelled
them
out
of
their
but
they
shook
off
the
dust
of
their
feet
against
and
came
unto
and
the
disciples
were
filled
with
and
with
the
holy
chapter
and
it
came
to
pass
in
that
they
went
both
together
into
the
synagogue
of
the
and
so
that
a
great
multitude
both
of
the
jews
and
also
of
the
greeks
but
the
unbelieving
jews
stirred
up
the
and
made
their
minds
evil
affected
against
the
long
time
therefore
abode
they
speaking
boldly
in
the
which
gave
testimony
unto
the
word
of
his
and
granted
signs
and
wonders
to
be
done
by
their
but
the
multitude
of
the
city
was
and
part
held
with
the
and
part
with
the
and
when
there
was
an
assault
made
both
of
the
and
also
of
the
jews
with
their
to
use
and
to
stone
they
were
ware
of
and
fled
unto
lystra
and
cities
of
and
unto
the
region
that
lieth
round
and
there
they
preached
the
and
there
sat
a
certain
man
at
impotent
in
his
being
a
cripple
from
his
who
never
had
the
same
heard
paul
who
stedfastly
beholding
and
perceiving
that
he
had
faith
to
be
said
with
a
loud
stand
upright
on
thy
and
he
leaped
and
and
when
the
people
saw
what
paul
had
they
lifted
up
their
saying
in
the
speech
of
the
gods
are
come
down
to
us
in
the
likeness
of
and
they
called
and
because
he
was
the
chief
then
the
priest
of
which
was
before
their
brought
oxen
and
garlands
unto
the
and
would
have
done
sacrifice
with
the
when
the
barnabas
and
heard
they
rent
their
and
ran
in
among
the
crying
and
why
do
ye
these
we
also
are
men
of
like
passions
with
and
preach
unto
you
that
ye
should
turn
from
these
vanities
unto
the
living
which
made
and
and
the
and
all
things
that
are
who
in
times
past
suffered
all
nations
to
walk
in
their
own
nevertheless
he
left
not
himself
without
in
that
he
did
and
gave
us
rain
from
and
fruitful
filling
our
hearts
with
food
and
and
with
these
sayings
scarce
restrained
they
the
that
they
had
not
done
sacrifice
unto
and
there
came
thither
jews
from
antioch
and
who
persuaded
the
having
stoned
drew
out
of
the
supposing
he
had
been
as
the
disciples
stood
round
about
he
rose
and
came
into
the
and
the
next
day
he
departed
with
barnabas
to
and
when
they
had
preached
the
gospel
to
that
and
had
taught
they
returned
again
to
and
and
confirming
the
souls
of
the
exhorting
them
to
continue
in
the
and
that
we
must
through
much
tribulation
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
and
when
they
had
ordained
them
elders
in
every
and
had
prayed
with
they
commended
them
to
the
on
whom
they
and
after
they
had
passed
throughout
they
came
to
and
when
they
had
preached
the
word
in
they
went
down
into
and
thence
sailed
to
from
whence
they
had
been
recommended
to
the
grace
of
god
for
the
work
which
they
and
when
they
were
and
had
gathered
the
church
they
rehearsed
all
that
god
had
done
with
and
how
he
had
opened
the
door
of
faith
unto
the
and
there
they
abode
long
time
with
the
chapter
and
certain
men
which
came
down
from
judaea
taught
the
except
ye
be
circumcised
after
the
manner
of
ye
cannot
be
when
therefore
paul
and
barnabas
had
no
small
dissension
and
disputation
with
they
determined
that
paul
and
and
certain
other
of
should
go
up
to
jerusalem
unto
the
apostles
and
elders
about
this
and
being
brought
on
their
way
by
the
they
passed
through
phenice
and
declaring
the
conversion
of
the
and
they
caused
great
joy
unto
all
the
and
when
they
were
come
to
they
were
received
of
the
and
the
apostles
and
and
they
declared
all
things
that
god
had
done
with
but
there
rose
up
certain
of
the
sect
of
the
pharisees
which
that
it
was
needful
to
circumcise
and
to
command
to
keep
the
law
of
and
the
apostles
and
elders
came
together
for
to
consider
of
this
and
when
there
had
been
much
peter
rose
and
said
unto
men
ye
know
how
that
a
good
while
ago
god
made
choice
among
that
the
gentiles
by
my
mouth
should
hear
the
word
of
the
and
and
which
knoweth
the
bare
them
giving
them
the
holy
even
as
unto
and
put
no
difference
between
us
and
purifying
their
hearts
by
now
therefore
why
tempt
ye
to
put
a
yoke
upon
the
neck
of
the
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
we
were
able
to
but
we
believe
that
through
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
we
shall
be
even
as
then
all
the
multitude
kept
and
gave
audience
to
barnabas
and
declaring
what
miracles
and
wonders
god
had
wrought
among
the
gentiles
by
and
after
they
had
held
their
james
men
hearken
unto
simeon
hath
declared
how
god
at
the
first
did
visit
the
to
take
out
of
them
a
people
for
his
and
to
this
agree
the
words
of
the
as
it
is
after
this
i
will
and
will
build
again
the
tabernacle
of
which
is
fallen
and
i
will
build
again
the
ruins
and
i
will
set
it
that
the
residue
of
men
might
seek
after
the
and
all
the
upon
whom
my
name
is
saith
the
who
doeth
all
these
known
unto
god
are
all
his
works
from
the
beginning
of
the
wherefore
my
sentence
that
we
trouble
not
which
from
among
the
gentiles
are
turned
to
but
that
we
write
unto
that
they
abstain
from
pollutions
of
and
and
things
and
for
moses
of
old
time
hath
in
every
city
them
that
preach
being
read
in
the
synagogues
every
sabbath
then
pleased
it
the
apostles
and
with
the
whole
to
send
chosen
men
of
their
own
company
to
antioch
with
paul
and
judas
surnamed
and
chief
men
among
the
and
they
wrote
by
them
after
this
the
apostles
and
elders
and
brethren
greeting
unto
the
brethren
which
are
of
the
gentiles
in
antioch
and
syria
and
forasmuch
as
we
have
that
certain
which
went
out
from
us
have
troubled
you
with
subverting
your
be
and
keep
the
to
whom
we
gave
no
it
seemed
good
unto
being
assembled
with
one
to
send
chosen
men
unto
you
with
our
beloved
barnabas
and
men
that
have
hazarded
their
lives
for
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
we
have
sent
therefore
judas
and
who
shall
also
tell
the
same
things
by
for
it
seemed
good
to
the
holy
and
to
to
lay
upon
you
no
greater
burden
than
these
necessary
that
ye
abstain
from
meats
offered
to
and
from
and
from
things
and
from
from
which
if
ye
keep
ye
shall
do
fare
ye
so
when
they
were
they
came
to
and
when
they
had
gathered
the
multitude
they
delivered
the
when
they
had
they
rejoiced
for
the
and
judas
and
being
prophets
also
exhorted
the
brethren
with
many
and
confirmed
and
after
they
had
tarried
a
they
were
let
go
in
peace
from
the
brethren
unto
the
notwithstanding
it
pleased
silas
to
abide
there
paul
also
and
barnabas
continued
in
teaching
and
preaching
the
word
of
the
with
many
others
and
some
days
after
paul
said
unto
let
us
go
again
and
visit
our
brethren
in
every
city
where
we
have
preached
the
word
of
the
how
they
and
barnabas
determined
to
take
with
them
whose
surname
was
but
paul
thought
not
good
to
take
him
with
who
departed
from
them
from
and
went
not
with
them
to
the
and
the
contention
was
so
sharp
between
that
they
departed
asunder
one
from
the
and
so
barnabas
took
and
sailed
unto
and
paul
chose
and
being
recommended
by
the
brethren
unto
the
grace
of
and
he
went
through
syria
and
confirming
the
chapter
then
came
he
to
derbe
and
a
certain
disciple
was
named
the
son
of
a
certain
which
was
a
and
but
his
father
a
which
was
well
reported
of
by
the
brethren
that
were
at
lystra
and
him
would
paul
have
to
go
forth
with
and
took
and
circumcised
him
because
of
the
jews
which
were
in
those
for
they
knew
all
that
his
father
was
a
and
as
they
went
through
the
they
delivered
them
the
decrees
for
to
that
were
ordained
of
the
apostles
and
elders
which
were
at
and
so
were
the
churches
established
in
the
and
increased
in
number
now
when
they
had
gone
throughout
phrygia
and
the
region
of
and
were
forbidden
of
the
holy
ghost
to
preach
the
word
in
after
they
were
come
to
they
assayed
to
go
into
but
the
spirit
suffered
them
and
they
passing
by
mysia
came
down
to
and
a
vision
appeared
to
paul
in
the
there
stood
a
man
of
and
prayed
come
over
into
and
help
and
after
he
had
seen
the
immediately
we
endeavoured
to
go
into
assuredly
gathering
that
the
lord
had
called
us
for
to
preach
the
gospel
unto
therefore
loosing
from
we
came
with
a
straight
course
to
and
the
next
to
and
from
thence
to
which
is
the
chief
city
of
that
part
of
a
and
we
were
in
that
city
abiding
certain
and
on
the
sabbath
we
went
out
of
the
city
by
a
river
where
prayer
was
wont
to
be
and
we
sat
and
spake
unto
the
women
which
resorted
and
a
certain
woman
named
a
seller
of
of
the
city
of
which
worshipped
heard
whose
heart
the
lord
that
she
attended
unto
the
things
which
were
spoken
of
and
when
she
was
and
her
she
besought
if
ye
have
judged
me
to
be
faithful
to
the
come
into
my
and
abide
and
she
constrained
and
it
came
to
as
we
went
to
a
certain
damsel
possessed
with
a
spirit
of
divination
met
which
brought
her
masters
much
gain
by
the
same
followed
paul
and
and
these
men
are
the
servants
of
the
most
high
which
shew
unto
us
the
way
of
and
this
did
she
many
but
being
turned
and
said
to
the
i
command
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
to
come
out
of
and
he
came
out
the
same
and
when
her
masters
saw
that
the
hope
of
their
gains
was
they
caught
paul
and
and
drew
into
the
marketplace
unto
the
and
brought
them
to
the
these
being
do
exceedingly
trouble
our
and
teach
which
are
not
lawful
for
us
to
neither
to
being
and
the
multitude
rose
up
together
against
and
the
magistrates
rent
off
their
and
commanded
to
beat
and
when
they
had
laid
many
stripes
upon
they
cast
into
charging
the
jailor
to
keep
them
having
received
such
a
thrust
them
into
the
inner
and
made
their
feet
fast
in
the
and
at
midnight
paul
and
silas
and
sang
praises
unto
and
the
prisoners
heard
and
suddenly
there
was
a
great
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
and
immediately
all
the
doors
were
and
every
bands
were
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
awaking
out
of
his
and
seeing
the
prison
doors
he
drew
out
his
and
would
have
killed
supposing
that
the
prisoners
had
been
but
paul
cried
with
a
loud
do
thyself
no
for
we
are
all
then
he
called
for
a
and
sprang
and
came
and
fell
down
before
paul
and
and
brought
them
and
what
must
i
do
to
be
and
they
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
and
thou
shalt
be
and
thy
and
they
spake
unto
him
the
word
of
the
and
to
all
that
were
in
his
and
he
took
them
the
same
hour
of
the
and
washed
and
was
he
and
all
and
when
he
had
brought
them
into
his
he
set
meat
before
and
believing
in
god
with
all
his
and
when
it
was
the
magistrates
sent
the
let
those
men
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
told
this
saying
to
the
magistrates
have
sent
to
let
you
now
therefore
and
go
in
but
paul
said
unto
they
have
beaten
us
openly
being
and
have
cast
into
and
now
do
they
thrust
us
out
nay
but
let
them
come
themselves
and
fetch
us
and
the
serjeants
told
these
words
unto
the
and
they
when
they
heard
that
they
were
and
they
came
and
besought
and
brought
and
desired
to
depart
out
of
the
and
they
went
out
of
the
and
entered
into
house
and
when
they
had
seen
the
they
comforted
and
chapter
now
when
they
had
passed
through
amphipolis
and
they
came
to
where
was
a
synagogue
of
the
and
as
his
manner
went
in
unto
and
three
sabbath
days
reasoned
with
them
out
of
the
opening
and
that
christ
must
needs
have
and
risen
again
from
the
and
that
this
whom
i
preach
unto
is
and
some
of
them
and
consorted
with
paul
and
and
of
the
devout
greeks
a
great
and
of
the
chief
women
not
a
but
the
jews
which
believed
moved
with
took
unto
them
certain
lewd
fellows
of
the
baser
and
gathered
a
and
set
all
the
city
on
an
and
assaulted
the
house
of
and
sought
to
bring
them
out
to
the
and
when
they
found
them
they
drew
jason
and
certain
brethren
unto
the
rulers
of
the
these
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
are
come
hither
whom
jason
hath
and
these
all
do
contrary
to
the
decrees
of
saying
that
there
is
another
and
they
troubled
the
people
and
the
rulers
of
the
when
they
heard
these
and
when
they
had
taken
security
of
and
of
the
they
let
them
and
the
brethren
immediately
sent
away
paul
and
silas
by
night
unto
who
coming
went
into
the
synagogue
of
the
these
were
more
noble
than
those
in
in
that
they
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
of
and
searched
the
scriptures
whether
those
things
were
therefore
many
of
them
also
of
honourable
women
which
were
and
of
not
a
but
when
the
jews
of
thessalonica
had
knowledge
that
the
word
of
god
was
preached
of
paul
at
they
came
thither
and
stirred
up
the
and
then
immediately
the
brethren
sent
away
paul
to
go
as
it
were
to
the
but
silas
and
timotheus
abode
there
and
they
that
conducted
paul
brought
him
unto
and
receiving
a
commandment
unto
silas
and
timotheus
for
to
come
to
him
with
all
they
now
while
paul
waited
for
them
at
his
spirit
was
stirred
in
when
he
saw
the
city
wholly
given
to
therefore
disputed
he
in
the
synagogue
with
the
and
with
the
devout
and
in
the
market
daily
with
them
that
met
with
then
certain
philosophers
of
the
and
of
the
encountered
and
some
what
will
this
babbler
other
he
seemeth
to
be
a
setter
forth
of
strange
because
he
preached
unto
them
and
the
and
they
took
and
brought
him
unto
may
we
know
what
this
new
whereof
thou
for
thou
bringest
certain
strange
things
to
our
we
would
know
therefore
what
these
things
all
the
athenians
and
strangers
which
were
there
spent
their
time
in
nothing
but
either
to
or
to
hear
some
new
then
paul
stood
in
the
midst
of
and
men
of
i
perceive
that
in
all
things
ye
are
too
for
as
i
passed
and
beheld
your
i
found
an
altar
with
this
to
the
unknown
whom
therefore
ye
ignorantly
him
declare
i
unto
god
that
made
the
world
and
all
things
seeing
that
he
is
lord
of
heaven
and
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
neither
is
worshipped
with
as
though
he
needed
any
seeing
he
giveth
to
all
and
and
all
and
hath
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
for
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
and
hath
determined
the
times
before
and
the
bounds
of
their
that
they
should
seek
the
if
haply
they
might
feel
after
and
find
though
he
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
for
in
him
we
and
and
have
our
as
certain
also
of
your
own
poets
have
for
we
are
also
his
forasmuch
then
as
we
are
the
offspring
of
we
ought
not
to
think
that
the
godhead
is
like
unto
or
or
graven
by
art
and
and
the
times
of
this
ignorance
god
winked
but
now
commandeth
all
men
every
where
to
because
he
hath
appointed
a
in
the
which
he
will
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
man
whom
he
hath
he
hath
given
assurance
unto
all
in
that
he
hath
raised
him
from
the
and
when
they
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
some
and
others
we
will
hear
thee
again
of
this
so
paul
departed
from
among
howbeit
certain
men
clave
unto
and
among
the
which
dionysius
the
and
a
woman
named
and
others
with
chapter
after
these
things
paul
departed
from
and
came
to
and
found
a
certain
jew
named
born
in
lately
come
from
with
his
wife
that
claudius
had
commanded
all
jews
to
depart
from
and
came
unto
and
because
he
was
of
the
same
he
abode
with
and
for
by
their
occupation
they
were
and
he
reasoned
in
the
synagogue
every
and
persuaded
the
jews
and
the
and
when
silas
and
timotheus
were
come
from
paul
was
pressed
in
the
and
testified
to
the
jews
jesus
and
when
they
opposed
and
he
shook
and
said
unto
your
blood
upon
your
own
i
from
henceforth
i
will
go
unto
the
and
he
departed
and
entered
into
a
certain
named
that
worshipped
whose
house
joined
hard
to
the
and
the
chief
ruler
of
the
believed
on
the
lord
with
all
his
and
many
of
the
corinthians
hearing
and
were
then
spake
the
lord
to
paul
in
the
night
by
a
be
not
but
and
hold
not
thy
for
i
am
with
and
no
man
shall
set
on
thee
to
hurt
for
i
have
much
people
in
this
and
he
continued
a
year
and
six
teaching
the
word
of
god
among
and
when
gallio
was
the
deputy
of
the
jews
made
insurrection
with
one
accord
against
and
brought
him
to
the
judgment
this
persuadeth
men
to
worship
god
contrary
to
the
and
when
paul
was
now
about
to
open
gallio
said
unto
the
if
it
were
a
matter
of
wrong
or
wicked
o
reason
would
that
i
should
bear
with
but
if
it
be
a
question
of
words
and
and
your
look
ye
for
i
will
be
no
judge
of
such
and
he
drave
them
from
the
judgment
then
all
the
greeks
took
the
chief
ruler
of
the
and
beat
before
the
judgment
and
gallio
cared
for
none
of
those
and
paul
tarried
yet
a
good
and
then
took
his
leave
of
the
and
sailed
thence
into
and
with
him
priscilla
and
having
shorn
head
in
for
he
had
a
and
he
came
to
and
left
them
but
he
himself
entered
into
the
and
reasoned
with
the
when
they
desired
to
tarry
longer
time
with
he
consented
but
bade
them
i
must
by
all
means
keep
this
feast
that
cometh
in
but
i
will
return
again
unto
if
god
and
he
sailed
from
and
when
he
had
landed
at
and
gone
and
saluted
the
he
went
down
to
and
after
he
had
spent
some
time
he
and
went
over
the
country
of
galatia
and
phrygia
in
strengthening
all
the
and
a
certain
jew
named
born
at
an
eloquent
mighty
in
the
came
to
this
man
was
instructed
in
the
way
of
the
and
being
fervent
in
the
he
spake
and
taught
diligently
the
things
of
the
knowing
only
the
baptism
of
and
he
began
to
speak
boldly
in
the
whom
when
aquila
and
priscilla
had
they
took
him
unto
and
expounded
unto
him
the
way
of
god
more
and
when
he
was
disposed
to
pass
into
the
brethren
exhorting
the
disciples
to
receive
when
he
was
helped
them
much
which
had
believed
through
for
he
mightily
convinced
the
shewing
by
the
scriptures
that
jesus
was
chapter
and
it
came
to
while
apollos
was
at
paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
and
finding
certain
he
said
unto
have
ye
received
the
holy
ghost
since
ye
and
they
said
unto
we
have
not
so
much
as
heard
whether
there
be
any
holy
and
he
said
unto
unto
what
then
were
ye
and
they
unto
then
said
john
verily
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
saying
unto
the
that
they
should
believe
on
him
which
should
come
after
that
on
christ
when
they
heard
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
when
paul
had
laid
hands
upon
the
holy
ghost
came
on
and
they
spake
with
and
and
all
the
men
were
about
and
he
went
into
the
and
spake
boldly
for
the
space
of
three
disputing
and
persuading
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
but
when
divers
were
and
believed
but
spake
evil
of
that
way
before
the
he
departed
from
and
separated
the
disputing
daily
in
the
school
of
one
and
this
continued
by
the
space
of
two
so
that
all
they
which
dwelt
in
asia
heard
the
word
of
the
lord
both
jews
and
and
god
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
so
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
or
and
the
diseases
departed
from
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
of
then
certain
of
the
vagabond
took
upon
them
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
lord
we
adjure
you
by
jesus
whom
paul
and
there
were
seven
sons
of
a
chief
of
the
which
did
and
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
jesus
i
and
paul
i
but
who
are
and
the
man
in
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
on
and
overcame
and
prevailed
against
so
that
they
fled
out
of
that
house
naked
and
and
this
was
known
to
all
the
jews
and
greeks
also
dwelling
at
and
fear
fell
on
them
and
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
was
and
many
that
believed
and
and
shewed
their
many
of
them
also
which
used
curious
arts
brought
their
books
and
burned
them
before
all
and
they
counted
the
price
of
and
found
fifty
thousand
of
so
mightily
grew
the
word
of
god
and
after
these
things
were
paul
purposed
in
the
when
he
had
passed
through
macedonia
and
to
go
to
after
i
have
been
i
must
also
see
so
he
sent
into
macedonia
two
of
them
that
ministered
unto
timotheus
and
but
he
himself
stayed
in
asia
for
a
and
the
same
time
there
arose
no
small
stir
about
that
for
a
certain
named
a
which
made
silver
shrines
for
brought
no
small
gain
unto
the
whom
he
called
together
with
the
workmen
of
like
and
ye
know
that
by
this
craft
we
have
our
moreover
ye
see
and
that
not
alone
at
but
almost
throughout
all
this
paul
hath
persuaded
and
turned
away
much
saying
that
they
be
no
which
are
made
with
so
that
not
only
this
our
craft
is
in
danger
to
be
set
at
but
also
that
the
temple
of
the
great
goddess
diana
should
be
and
her
magnificence
should
be
whom
all
asia
and
the
world
and
when
they
heard
they
were
full
of
and
cried
great
diana
of
the
and
the
whole
city
was
filled
with
and
having
caught
gaius
and
men
of
companions
in
they
rushed
with
one
accord
into
the
and
when
paul
would
have
entered
in
unto
the
the
disciples
suffered
him
and
certain
of
the
chief
of
which
were
his
sent
unto
desiring
that
he
would
not
adventure
himself
into
the
some
therefore
cried
one
and
some
for
the
assembly
was
and
the
more
part
knew
not
wherefore
they
were
come
and
they
drew
alexander
out
of
the
the
jews
putting
him
and
alexander
beckoned
with
the
and
would
have
made
his
defence
unto
the
but
when
they
knew
that
he
was
a
all
with
one
voice
about
the
space
of
two
hours
cried
great
diana
of
the
and
when
the
townclerk
had
appeased
the
he
men
of
what
man
is
there
that
knoweth
not
how
that
the
city
of
the
ephesians
is
a
worshipper
of
the
great
goddess
and
of
the
which
fell
down
from
seeing
then
that
these
things
cannot
be
spoken
ye
ought
to
be
and
to
do
nothing
for
ye
have
brought
hither
these
which
are
neither
robbers
of
nor
yet
blasphemers
of
your
wherefore
if
and
the
craftsmen
which
are
with
have
a
matter
against
any
the
law
is
and
there
are
let
them
implead
one
but
if
ye
enquire
any
thing
concerning
other
it
shall
be
determined
in
a
lawful
for
we
are
in
danger
to
be
called
in
question
for
this
there
being
no
cause
whereby
we
may
give
an
account
of
this
and
when
he
had
thus
he
dismissed
the
chapter
and
after
the
uproar
was
paul
called
unto
the
and
embraced
and
departed
for
to
go
into
and
when
he
had
gone
over
those
and
had
given
them
much
he
came
into
and
abode
three
and
when
the
jews
laid
wait
for
as
he
was
about
to
sail
into
he
purposed
to
return
through
and
there
accompanied
him
into
asia
sopater
of
and
of
the
aristarchus
and
and
gaius
of
and
and
of
tychicus
and
these
going
before
tarried
for
us
at
and
we
sailed
away
from
philippi
after
the
days
of
unleavened
and
came
unto
them
to
troas
in
five
where
we
abode
seven
and
upon
the
first
of
the
when
the
disciples
came
together
to
break
paul
preached
unto
ready
to
depart
on
the
and
continued
his
speech
until
and
there
were
many
lights
in
the
upper
where
they
were
gathered
and
there
sat
in
a
window
a
certain
young
man
named
being
fallen
into
a
deep
and
as
paul
was
long
he
sunk
down
with
and
fell
down
from
the
third
and
was
taken
up
and
paul
went
and
fell
on
and
embracing
trouble
not
for
his
life
is
in
when
he
therefore
was
come
up
and
had
broken
and
and
talked
a
long
even
till
break
of
so
he
and
they
brought
the
young
man
and
were
not
a
little
and
we
went
before
to
and
sailed
unto
there
intending
to
take
in
for
so
had
he
minding
himself
to
go
and
when
he
met
with
us
at
we
took
him
and
came
to
and
we
sailed
and
came
the
next
over
against
and
the
next
we
arrived
at
and
tarried
at
and
the
next
we
came
to
for
paul
had
determined
to
sail
by
because
he
would
not
spend
the
time
in
for
he
if
it
were
possible
for
to
be
at
jerusalem
the
day
of
and
from
miletus
he
sent
to
and
called
the
elders
of
the
and
when
they
were
come
to
he
said
unto
ye
from
the
first
day
that
i
came
into
after
what
manner
i
have
been
with
you
at
all
serving
the
lord
with
all
humility
of
and
with
many
and
which
befell
me
by
the
lying
in
wait
of
the
how
i
kept
back
nothing
that
was
profitable
but
have
shewed
and
have
taught
you
and
from
house
to
testifying
both
to
the
and
also
to
the
repentance
toward
and
faith
toward
our
lord
jesus
and
i
go
bound
in
the
spirit
unto
not
knowing
the
things
that
shall
befall
me
save
that
the
holy
ghost
witnesseth
in
every
saying
that
bonds
and
afflictions
abide
but
none
of
these
things
move
neither
count
i
my
life
dear
unto
so
that
i
might
finish
my
course
with
and
the
which
i
have
received
of
the
lord
to
testify
the
gospel
of
the
grace
of
and
i
know
that
ye
among
whom
i
have
gone
preaching
the
kingdom
of
shall
see
my
face
no
wherefore
i
take
you
to
record
this
that
i
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
for
i
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
take
heed
therefore
unto
and
to
all
the
over
the
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
to
feed
the
church
of
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
for
i
know
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
among
not
sparing
the
also
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
speaking
perverse
to
draw
away
disciples
after
therefore
and
that
by
the
space
of
three
years
i
ceased
not
to
warn
every
one
night
and
day
with
and
i
commend
you
to
and
to
the
word
of
his
which
is
able
to
build
you
and
to
give
you
an
inheritance
among
all
them
which
are
i
have
coveted
no
or
or
ye
yourselves
that
these
hands
have
ministered
unto
my
and
to
them
that
were
with
i
have
shewed
you
all
how
that
so
labouring
ye
ought
to
support
the
and
to
remember
the
words
of
the
lord
how
he
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
and
when
he
had
thus
he
kneeled
and
prayed
with
them
and
they
all
wept
and
fell
on
and
kissed
sorrowing
most
of
all
for
the
words
which
he
that
they
should
see
his
face
no
and
they
accompanied
him
unto
the
chapter
and
it
came
to
that
after
we
were
gotten
from
and
had
we
came
with
a
straight
course
unto
and
the
following
unto
and
from
thence
unto
and
finding
a
ship
sailing
over
unto
we
went
and
set
now
when
we
had
discovered
we
left
it
on
the
left
and
sailed
into
and
landed
at
for
there
the
ship
was
to
unlade
her
and
finding
we
tarried
there
seven
who
said
to
paul
through
the
that
he
should
not
go
up
to
and
when
we
had
accomplished
those
we
departed
and
went
our
and
they
all
brought
us
on
our
with
wives
and
till
out
of
the
and
we
kneeled
down
on
the
and
and
when
we
had
taken
our
leave
one
of
we
took
and
they
returned
home
and
when
we
had
finished
course
from
we
came
to
and
saluted
the
and
abode
with
them
one
and
the
next
we
that
were
of
company
and
came
unto
and
we
entered
into
the
house
of
philip
the
which
was
of
the
and
abode
with
and
the
same
man
had
four
which
did
and
as
we
tarried
many
there
came
down
from
judaea
a
certain
named
and
when
he
was
come
unto
he
took
and
bound
his
own
hands
and
and
thus
saith
the
holy
so
shall
the
jews
at
jerusalem
bind
the
man
that
owneth
this
and
shall
deliver
into
the
hands
of
the
and
when
we
heard
these
both
and
they
of
that
besought
him
not
to
go
up
to
then
paul
what
mean
ye
to
weep
and
to
break
mine
for
i
am
ready
not
to
be
bound
but
also
to
die
at
jerusalem
for
the
name
of
the
lord
and
when
he
would
not
be
we
the
will
of
the
lord
be
and
after
those
days
we
took
up
our
and
went
up
to
there
went
with
us
also
of
the
disciples
of
and
brought
with
them
one
mnason
of
an
old
with
whom
we
should
and
when
we
were
come
to
the
brethren
received
us
and
the
following
paul
went
in
with
us
unto
and
all
the
elders
were
and
when
he
had
saluted
he
declared
particularly
what
things
god
had
wrought
among
the
gentiles
by
his
and
when
they
heard
they
glorified
the
and
said
unto
thou
how
many
thousands
of
jews
there
are
which
and
they
are
all
zealous
of
the
and
they
are
informed
of
that
thou
teachest
all
the
jews
which
are
among
the
gentiles
to
forsake
saying
that
they
ought
not
to
circumcise
neither
to
walk
after
the
what
is
it
the
multitude
must
needs
come
for
they
will
hear
that
thou
art
do
therefore
this
that
we
say
to
we
have
four
men
which
have
a
vow
on
them
and
purify
thyself
with
and
be
at
charges
with
that
they
may
shave
and
all
may
know
that
those
whereof
they
were
informed
concerning
are
but
thou
thyself
also
walkest
and
keepest
the
as
touching
the
gentiles
which
we
have
written
concluded
that
they
observe
no
such
save
only
that
they
keep
themselves
from
offered
to
and
from
and
from
and
from
then
paul
took
the
and
the
next
day
purifying
himself
with
them
entered
into
the
to
signify
the
accomplishment
of
the
days
of
until
that
an
offering
should
be
offered
for
every
one
of
and
when
the
seven
days
were
almost
the
jews
which
were
of
when
they
saw
him
in
the
stirred
up
all
the
and
laid
hands
on
crying
men
of
this
is
the
that
teacheth
all
every
where
against
the
and
the
and
this
and
further
brought
greeks
also
into
the
and
hath
polluted
this
holy
they
had
seen
before
with
him
in
the
city
trophimus
an
whom
they
supposed
that
paul
had
brought
into
the
and
all
the
city
was
and
the
people
ran
and
they
took
and
drew
him
out
of
the
and
forthwith
the
doors
were
and
as
they
went
about
to
kill
tidings
came
unto
the
chief
captain
of
the
that
all
jerusalem
was
in
an
who
immediately
took
soldiers
and
and
ran
down
unto
and
when
they
saw
the
chief
captain
and
the
they
left
beating
of
then
the
chief
captain
came
and
took
and
commanded
to
be
bound
with
two
and
demanded
who
he
and
what
he
had
and
some
cried
one
some
among
the
and
when
he
could
not
know
the
certainty
for
the
he
commanded
him
to
be
carried
into
the
and
when
he
came
upon
the
so
it
that
he
was
borne
of
the
soldiers
for
the
violence
of
the
for
the
multitude
of
the
people
followed
away
with
and
as
paul
was
to
be
led
into
the
he
said
unto
the
chief
may
i
speak
unto
who
canst
thou
speak
art
not
thou
that
which
before
these
days
madest
an
and
leddest
out
into
the
wilderness
four
thousand
men
that
were
but
paul
i
am
a
man
a
jew
of
in
a
citizen
of
no
mean
i
beseech
suffer
me
to
speak
unto
the
and
when
he
had
given
him
paul
stood
on
the
and
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
and
when
there
was
made
a
great
he
spake
unto
in
the
hebrew
chapter
and
hear
ye
my
defence
i
now
unto
when
they
heard
that
he
spake
in
the
hebrew
tongue
to
they
kept
the
more
and
he
i
am
verily
a
man
a
born
in
in
yet
brought
up
in
this
city
at
the
feet
of
taught
according
to
the
perfect
manner
of
the
law
of
the
and
was
zealous
toward
as
ye
all
are
this
and
i
persecuted
this
way
unto
the
binding
and
delivering
into
prisons
both
men
and
as
also
the
high
priest
doth
bear
me
and
all
the
estate
of
the
from
whom
also
i
received
letters
unto
the
and
went
to
to
bring
them
which
were
there
bound
unto
for
to
be
and
it
came
to
as
i
made
my
and
was
come
nigh
unto
damascus
about
suddenly
there
shone
from
heaven
a
great
light
round
about
and
i
fell
unto
the
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
why
persecutest
thou
and
i
who
art
and
he
said
unto
i
am
jesus
of
whom
thou
and
they
that
were
with
me
saw
indeed
the
and
were
but
they
heard
not
the
voice
of
him
that
spake
to
and
i
what
shall
i
and
the
lord
said
unto
and
go
into
and
there
it
shall
be
told
thee
of
all
things
which
are
appointed
for
thee
to
and
when
i
could
not
see
for
the
glory
of
that
being
led
by
the
hand
of
them
that
were
with
i
came
into
and
one
a
devout
man
according
to
the
having
a
good
report
of
all
the
jews
which
dwelt
came
unto
and
and
said
unto
brother
receive
thy
and
the
same
hour
i
looked
up
upon
and
he
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
that
thou
shouldest
know
his
and
see
that
just
and
shouldest
hear
the
voice
of
his
for
thou
shalt
be
his
witness
unto
all
men
of
what
thou
hast
seen
and
and
now
why
tarriest
and
be
and
wash
away
thy
calling
on
the
name
of
the
and
it
came
to
when
i
was
come
again
to
even
while
i
prayed
in
the
i
was
in
a
and
saw
him
saying
unto
make
and
get
thee
quickly
out
of
for
they
will
not
receive
thy
testimony
concerning
and
i
they
know
that
i
imprisoned
and
beat
in
every
synagogue
them
that
believed
on
and
when
the
blood
of
thy
martyr
stephen
was
i
also
was
standing
and
consenting
unto
his
and
kept
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
and
he
said
unto
for
i
will
send
thee
far
hence
unto
the
and
they
gave
him
audience
unto
this
and
lifted
up
their
and
away
with
such
a
from
the
for
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
and
as
they
cried
and
cast
off
and
threw
dust
into
the
the
chief
captain
commanded
him
to
be
brought
into
the
and
bade
that
he
should
be
examined
by
that
he
might
know
wherefore
they
cried
so
against
and
as
they
bound
him
with
paul
said
unto
the
centurion
that
stood
is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
a
and
when
the
centurion
heard
he
went
and
told
the
chief
take
heed
what
thou
for
this
man
is
a
then
the
chief
captain
and
said
unto
tell
art
thou
a
he
and
the
chief
captain
with
a
great
sum
obtained
i
this
and
paul
but
i
was
then
straightway
they
departed
from
him
which
should
have
examined
and
the
chief
captain
also
was
after
he
knew
that
he
was
a
and
because
he
had
bound
on
the
because
he
would
have
known
the
certainty
wherefore
he
was
accused
of
the
he
loosed
him
from
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
their
council
to
and
brought
paul
and
set
him
before
chapter
and
earnestly
beholding
the
men
i
have
lived
in
all
good
conscience
before
god
until
this
and
the
high
priest
ananias
commanded
them
that
stood
by
him
to
smite
him
on
the
then
said
paul
unto
god
shall
smite
whited
for
sittest
thou
to
judge
me
after
the
and
commandest
me
to
be
smitten
contrary
to
the
and
they
that
stood
by
revilest
thou
high
then
said
i
wist
that
he
was
the
high
for
it
is
thou
shalt
not
speak
evil
of
the
ruler
of
thy
but
when
paul
perceived
that
the
one
part
were
and
the
other
he
cried
out
in
the
men
i
am
a
the
son
of
a
of
the
hope
and
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
am
called
in
and
when
he
had
so
there
arose
a
dissension
between
the
pharisees
and
the
and
the
multitude
was
for
the
sadducees
say
that
there
is
no
neither
nor
but
the
pharisees
confess
and
there
arose
a
great
and
the
scribes
of
the
part
and
we
find
no
evil
in
this
but
if
a
spirit
or
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
let
us
not
fight
against
and
when
there
arose
a
great
the
chief
fearing
lest
paul
should
have
been
pulled
in
pieces
of
commanded
the
soldiers
to
go
and
to
take
him
by
force
from
among
and
to
bring
into
the
and
the
night
following
the
lord
stood
by
and
be
of
good
for
as
thou
hast
testified
of
me
in
so
must
thou
bear
witness
also
at
and
when
it
was
certain
of
the
jews
banded
and
bound
themselves
under
a
saying
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
had
killed
and
they
were
more
than
forty
which
had
made
this
and
they
came
to
the
chief
priests
and
and
we
have
bound
ourselves
under
a
great
that
we
will
eat
nothing
until
we
have
slain
now
therefore
ye
with
the
council
signify
to
the
chief
captain
that
he
bring
him
down
unto
you
to
as
though
ye
would
enquire
something
more
perfectly
concerning
and
or
ever
he
come
are
ready
to
kill
and
when
son
heard
of
their
lying
in
he
went
and
entered
into
the
and
told
then
paul
called
one
of
the
centurions
unto
and
bring
this
young
man
unto
the
chief
for
he
hath
a
certain
thing
to
tell
so
he
took
and
brought
to
the
chief
and
paul
the
prisoner
called
me
unto
and
prayed
me
to
bring
this
young
man
unto
who
hath
something
to
say
unto
then
the
chief
captain
took
him
by
the
and
went
aside
and
asked
what
is
that
thou
hast
to
tell
and
he
the
jews
have
agreed
to
desire
thee
that
thou
wouldest
bring
down
paul
to
morrow
into
the
as
though
they
would
enquire
somewhat
of
him
more
but
do
not
thou
yield
unto
for
there
lie
in
wait
for
him
of
them
more
than
forty
which
have
bound
themselves
with
an
that
they
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
have
killed
and
now
are
they
looking
for
a
promise
from
so
the
chief
captain
let
the
young
man
and
charged
see
tell
no
man
that
thou
hast
shewed
these
things
to
and
he
called
unto
two
make
ready
two
hundred
soldiers
to
go
to
and
horsemen
threescore
and
and
spearmen
two
at
the
third
hour
of
the
and
provide
that
they
may
set
paul
and
bring
safe
unto
felix
the
and
he
wrote
a
letter
after
this
claudius
lysias
unto
the
most
excellent
governor
felix
this
man
was
taken
of
the
and
should
have
been
killed
of
then
came
i
with
an
and
rescued
having
understood
that
he
was
a
and
when
i
would
have
known
the
cause
wherefore
they
accused
i
brought
him
forth
into
their
whom
i
perceived
to
be
accused
of
questions
of
their
but
to
have
nothing
laid
to
his
charge
worthy
of
death
or
of
and
when
it
was
told
me
how
that
the
jews
laid
wait
for
the
i
sent
straightway
to
and
gave
commandment
to
his
accusers
also
to
say
before
thee
what
against
then
the
as
it
was
commanded
took
and
brought
by
night
to
on
the
morrow
they
left
the
horsemen
to
go
with
and
returned
to
the
when
they
came
to
and
delivered
the
epistle
to
the
presented
paul
also
before
and
when
the
governor
had
read
he
asked
of
what
province
he
and
when
he
understood
that
of
i
will
hear
said
when
thine
accusers
are
also
and
he
commanded
him
to
be
kept
in
judgment
chapter
and
after
five
days
ananias
the
high
priest
descended
with
the
and
a
certain
orator
who
informed
the
governor
against
and
when
he
was
called
tertullus
began
to
accuse
seeing
that
by
thee
we
enjoy
great
and
that
very
worthy
deeds
are
done
unto
this
nation
by
thy
we
accept
and
in
all
most
noble
with
all
that
i
be
not
further
tedious
unto
i
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
hear
us
of
thy
clemency
a
few
for
we
have
found
this
man
pestilent
and
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
jews
throughout
the
and
a
ringleader
of
the
sect
of
the
who
also
hath
gone
about
to
profane
the
whom
we
and
would
have
judged
according
to
our
but
the
chief
captain
lysias
came
and
with
great
violence
took
away
out
of
our
commanding
his
accusers
to
come
unto
by
examining
of
whom
thyself
mayest
take
knowledge
of
all
these
whereof
we
accuse
and
the
jews
also
saying
that
these
things
were
then
after
that
the
governor
had
beckoned
unto
him
to
forasmuch
as
i
know
that
thou
hast
been
of
many
years
a
judge
unto
this
i
do
the
more
cheerfully
answer
for
because
that
thou
mayest
that
there
are
yet
but
twelve
days
since
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
for
to
and
they
neither
found
me
in
the
temple
disputing
with
any
neither
raising
up
the
neither
in
the
nor
in
the
neither
can
they
prove
the
things
whereof
they
now
accuse
but
this
i
confess
unto
that
after
the
way
which
they
call
so
worship
i
the
god
of
my
believing
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
law
and
in
the
and
have
hope
toward
which
they
themselves
also
that
there
shall
be
a
resurrection
of
the
both
of
the
just
and
and
herein
do
i
exercise
to
have
always
a
conscience
void
of
offence
toward
and
now
after
many
years
i
came
to
bring
alms
to
my
and
whereupon
certain
jews
from
asia
found
me
purified
in
the
neither
with
nor
with
who
ought
to
have
been
here
before
and
if
they
had
ought
against
or
else
let
these
same
if
they
have
found
any
evil
doing
in
while
i
stood
before
the
except
it
be
for
this
one
that
i
cried
standing
among
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
am
called
in
question
by
you
this
and
when
felix
heard
these
having
more
perfect
knowledge
of
he
deferred
and
when
lysias
the
chief
captain
shall
come
i
will
know
the
uttermost
of
your
and
he
commanded
a
centurion
to
keep
and
to
let
have
and
that
he
should
forbid
none
of
his
acquaintance
to
minister
or
come
unto
and
after
certain
when
felix
came
with
his
wife
which
was
a
he
sent
for
and
heard
him
concerning
the
faith
in
and
as
he
reasoned
of
and
judgment
to
felix
and
go
thy
way
for
this
when
i
have
a
convenient
i
will
call
for
he
hoped
also
that
money
should
have
been
given
him
of
that
he
might
loose
wherefore
he
sent
for
him
the
and
communed
with
but
after
two
years
porcius
festus
came
into
and
willing
to
shew
the
jews
a
left
paul
chapter
now
when
festus
was
come
into
the
after
three
days
he
ascended
from
caesarea
to
then
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
of
the
jews
informed
him
against
and
besought
and
desired
favour
against
that
he
would
send
for
him
to
laying
wait
in
the
way
to
kill
but
festus
that
paul
should
be
kept
at
and
that
he
himself
would
depart
shortly
let
them
said
which
among
you
are
go
down
with
and
accuse
this
if
there
be
any
wickedness
in
and
when
he
had
tarried
among
them
more
than
ten
he
went
down
unto
and
the
next
day
sitting
on
the
judgment
seat
commanded
paul
to
be
and
when
he
was
the
jews
which
came
down
from
jerusalem
stood
round
and
laid
many
and
grievous
complaints
against
which
they
could
not
while
he
answered
for
neither
against
the
law
of
the
neither
against
the
nor
yet
against
have
i
offended
any
thing
at
but
willing
to
do
the
jews
a
answered
and
wilt
thou
go
up
to
and
there
be
judged
of
these
things
before
then
said
i
stand
at
judgment
where
i
ought
to
be
to
the
jews
have
i
done
no
as
thou
very
well
for
if
i
be
an
or
have
committed
any
thing
worthy
of
i
refuse
not
to
but
if
there
be
none
of
these
things
whereof
these
accuse
no
man
may
deliver
me
unto
i
appeal
unto
then
when
he
had
conferred
with
the
hast
thou
appealed
unto
unto
caesar
shalt
thou
and
after
certain
days
king
agrippa
and
bernice
came
unto
caesarea
to
salute
and
when
they
had
been
there
many
festus
declared
cause
unto
the
there
is
a
certain
man
left
in
bonds
by
about
when
i
was
at
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
jews
informed
desiring
judgment
against
to
whom
i
it
is
not
the
manner
of
the
romans
to
deliver
any
man
to
before
that
he
which
is
accused
have
the
accusers
face
to
and
have
licence
to
answer
for
himself
concerning
the
crime
laid
against
when
they
were
come
without
any
delay
on
the
morrow
i
sat
on
the
judgment
and
commanded
the
man
to
be
brought
against
whom
when
the
accusers
stood
they
brought
none
accusation
of
such
things
as
i
but
had
certain
questions
against
him
of
their
own
and
of
one
which
was
whom
paul
affirmed
to
be
and
because
i
doubted
of
such
manner
of
i
asked
whether
he
would
go
to
and
there
be
judged
of
these
but
when
paul
had
appealed
to
be
reserved
unto
the
hearing
of
i
commanded
him
to
be
kept
till
i
might
send
him
to
then
agrippa
said
unto
i
would
also
hear
the
man
to
said
thou
shalt
hear
and
on
the
when
agrippa
was
and
with
great
and
was
entered
into
the
place
of
with
the
chief
and
principal
men
of
the
at
commandment
paul
was
brought
and
festus
king
and
all
men
which
are
here
present
with
ye
see
this
about
whom
all
the
multitude
of
the
jews
have
dealt
with
both
at
and
crying
that
he
ought
not
to
live
any
but
when
i
found
that
he
had
committed
nothing
worthy
of
and
that
he
himself
hath
appealed
to
i
have
determined
to
send
of
whom
i
have
no
certain
thing
to
write
unto
my
wherefore
i
have
brought
him
forth
before
and
specially
before
o
king
after
examination
i
might
have
somewhat
to
for
it
seemeth
to
me
unreasonable
to
send
a
and
not
withal
to
signify
the
crimes
against
chapter
then
agrippa
said
unto
thou
art
permitted
to
speak
for
then
paul
stretched
forth
the
and
answered
for
i
think
myself
king
because
i
shall
answer
for
myself
this
day
before
thee
touching
all
the
things
whereof
i
am
accused
of
the
especially
i
thee
to
be
expert
in
all
customs
and
questions
which
are
among
the
wherefore
i
beseech
thee
to
hear
me
my
manner
of
life
from
my
which
was
at
the
first
among
mine
own
nation
at
know
all
the
which
knew
me
from
the
if
they
would
that
after
the
most
straitest
sect
of
our
religion
i
lived
a
and
now
i
stand
and
am
judged
for
the
hope
of
the
promise
made
of
god
unto
our
unto
which
our
twelve
instantly
serving
day
and
hope
to
for
which
king
i
am
accused
of
the
why
should
it
be
thought
a
thing
incredible
with
that
god
should
raise
the
i
verily
thought
with
that
i
ought
to
do
many
things
contrary
to
the
name
of
jesus
of
which
thing
i
also
did
in
and
many
of
the
saints
did
i
shut
up
in
having
received
authority
from
the
chief
and
when
they
were
put
to
i
gave
my
voice
against
and
i
punished
them
oft
in
every
and
compelled
to
and
being
exceedingly
mad
against
i
persecuted
even
unto
strange
whereupon
as
i
went
to
damascus
with
authority
and
commission
from
the
chief
at
o
i
saw
in
the
way
a
light
from
above
the
brightness
of
the
shining
round
about
me
and
them
which
journeyed
with
and
when
we
were
all
fallen
to
the
i
heard
a
voice
speaking
unto
and
saying
in
the
hebrew
why
persecutest
thou
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
and
i
who
art
and
he
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
but
and
stand
upon
thy
for
i
have
appeared
unto
thee
for
this
to
make
thee
a
minister
and
a
witness
both
of
these
things
which
thou
hast
and
of
those
things
in
the
which
i
will
appear
unto
delivering
thee
from
the
and
the
unto
whom
now
i
send
to
open
their
to
turn
from
darkness
to
and
the
power
of
satan
unto
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
o
king
i
was
not
disobedient
unto
the
heavenly
but
shewed
first
unto
them
of
and
at
and
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
and
to
the
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
and
do
works
meet
for
for
these
causes
the
jews
caught
me
in
the
and
went
about
to
kill
having
therefore
obtained
help
of
i
continue
unto
this
witnessing
both
to
small
and
saying
none
other
things
than
those
which
the
prophets
and
moses
did
say
should
that
christ
should
that
he
should
be
the
first
that
should
rise
from
the
and
should
shew
light
unto
the
and
to
the
and
as
he
thus
spake
for
festus
said
with
a
loud
thou
art
beside
much
learning
doth
make
thee
but
he
i
am
not
most
noble
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
for
the
king
knoweth
of
these
before
whom
also
i
speak
for
i
am
persuaded
that
none
of
these
things
are
hidden
from
for
this
thing
was
not
done
in
a
king
believest
thou
the
i
know
that
thou
then
agrippa
said
unto
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
and
paul
i
would
to
that
not
only
but
also
all
that
hear
me
this
were
both
and
altogether
such
as
i
except
these
and
when
he
had
thus
the
king
rose
and
the
and
and
they
that
sat
with
and
when
they
were
gone
they
talked
between
this
man
doeth
nothing
worthy
of
death
or
of
then
said
agrippa
unto
this
man
might
have
been
set
at
if
he
had
not
appealed
unto
chapter
and
when
it
was
determined
that
we
should
sail
into
they
delivered
paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
unto
named
a
centurion
of
and
entering
into
a
ship
of
we
meaning
to
sail
by
the
coasts
of
a
macedonian
of
being
with
and
the
next
we
touched
at
and
julius
courteously
entreated
and
gave
liberty
to
go
unto
his
friends
to
refresh
and
when
we
had
launched
from
we
sailed
under
because
the
winds
were
and
when
we
had
sailed
over
the
sea
of
cilicia
and
we
came
to
of
and
there
the
centurion
found
a
ship
of
alexandria
sailing
into
and
he
put
us
and
when
we
had
sailed
slowly
many
and
scarce
were
come
over
against
the
wind
not
suffering
we
sailed
under
over
against
hardly
passing
came
unto
a
place
which
is
called
the
fair
nigh
whereunto
was
the
city
now
when
much
time
was
and
when
sailing
was
now
because
the
fast
was
now
already
paul
admonished
and
said
unto
i
perceive
that
this
voyage
will
be
with
hurt
and
much
not
only
of
the
lading
and
but
also
of
our
nevertheless
the
centurion
believed
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
more
than
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
and
because
the
haven
was
not
commodious
to
winter
the
more
part
advised
to
depart
thence
if
by
any
means
they
might
attain
to
to
an
haven
of
and
lieth
toward
the
south
west
and
north
and
when
the
south
wind
blew
supposing
that
they
had
obtained
loosing
they
sailed
close
by
but
not
long
after
there
arose
against
it
a
tempestuous
called
and
when
the
ship
was
and
could
not
bear
up
into
the
we
let
and
running
under
a
certain
island
which
is
called
we
had
much
work
to
come
by
the
which
when
they
had
taken
they
used
undergirding
the
fearing
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
strake
and
so
were
and
we
being
exceedingly
tossed
with
a
the
next
they
lightened
the
and
the
third
we
cast
out
with
our
own
hands
the
tackling
of
the
and
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
in
many
days
and
no
small
tempest
lay
on
all
hope
that
we
should
be
saved
was
then
taken
but
after
long
abstinence
paul
stood
forth
in
the
midst
of
and
ye
should
have
hearkened
unto
and
not
have
loosed
from
and
to
have
gained
this
harm
and
and
now
i
exhort
you
to
be
of
good
for
there
shall
be
no
loss
of
life
among
but
of
the
for
there
stood
by
me
this
night
the
angel
of
whose
i
and
whom
i
fear
thou
must
be
brought
before
god
hath
given
thee
all
them
that
sail
with
be
of
good
for
i
believe
that
it
shall
be
even
as
it
was
told
howbeit
we
must
be
cast
upon
a
certain
but
when
the
fourteenth
night
was
as
we
were
driven
up
and
down
in
about
midnight
the
shipmen
deemed
that
they
drew
near
to
some
and
and
found
twenty
and
when
they
had
gone
a
little
they
sounded
and
found
fifteen
then
fearing
lest
we
should
have
fallen
upon
they
cast
four
anchors
out
of
the
and
wished
for
the
and
as
the
shipmen
were
about
to
flee
out
of
the
when
they
had
let
down
the
boat
into
the
under
colour
as
though
they
would
have
cast
anchors
out
of
the
paul
said
to
the
centurion
and
to
the
except
these
abide
in
the
ye
cannot
be
then
the
soldiers
cut
off
the
ropes
of
the
and
let
her
fall
and
while
the
day
was
coming
paul
besought
all
to
take
this
day
is
the
fourteenth
day
that
ye
have
tarried
and
continued
having
taken
wherefore
i
pray
you
to
take
for
this
is
for
your
for
there
shall
not
an
hair
fall
from
the
head
of
any
of
and
when
he
had
thus
he
took
and
gave
thanks
to
god
in
presence
of
them
and
when
he
had
broken
he
began
to
then
were
they
all
of
good
and
they
also
took
and
we
were
in
all
in
the
ship
two
hundred
threescore
and
sixteen
and
when
they
had
eaten
they
lightened
the
and
cast
out
the
wheat
into
the
and
when
it
was
they
knew
not
the
but
they
discovered
a
certain
creek
with
a
into
the
which
they
were
if
it
were
to
thrust
in
the
and
when
they
had
taken
up
the
they
committed
unto
the
and
loosed
the
rudder
and
hoised
up
the
mainsail
to
the
and
made
toward
and
falling
into
a
place
where
two
seas
they
ran
the
ship
and
the
forepart
stuck
and
remained
but
the
hinder
part
was
broken
with
the
violence
of
the
and
the
counsel
was
to
kill
the
lest
any
of
them
should
swim
and
but
the
willing
to
save
kept
them
from
and
commanded
that
they
which
could
swim
should
cast
first
the
and
get
to
and
the
some
on
and
some
on
of
the
and
so
it
came
to
that
they
escaped
all
safe
to
chapter
and
when
they
were
then
they
knew
that
the
island
was
called
and
the
barbarous
people
shewed
us
no
little
for
they
kindled
a
and
received
us
every
because
of
the
present
and
because
of
the
and
when
paul
had
gathered
a
bundle
of
and
laid
on
the
there
came
a
viper
out
of
the
and
fastened
on
his
and
when
the
barbarians
saw
the
beast
hang
on
his
they
said
among
no
doubt
this
man
is
a
though
he
hath
escaped
the
yet
vengeance
suffereth
not
to
and
he
shook
off
the
beast
into
the
and
felt
no
howbeit
they
looked
when
he
should
have
or
fallen
down
dead
but
after
they
had
looked
a
great
and
saw
no
harm
come
to
they
changed
their
and
said
that
he
was
a
in
the
same
quarters
were
possessions
of
the
chief
man
of
the
whose
name
was
who
received
and
lodged
us
three
days
and
it
came
to
that
the
father
of
publius
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
of
a
bloody
to
whom
paul
entered
and
and
laid
his
hands
on
and
healed
so
when
this
was
others
which
had
diseases
in
the
and
were
who
also
honoured
us
with
many
and
when
we
they
laded
with
such
things
as
were
and
after
three
months
we
departed
in
a
ship
of
which
had
wintered
in
the
whose
sign
was
castor
and
and
landing
at
we
tarried
three
and
from
thence
we
fetched
a
and
came
to
and
after
one
day
the
south
wind
and
we
came
the
next
day
to
where
we
found
and
were
desired
to
tarry
with
them
seven
and
so
we
went
toward
and
from
when
the
brethren
heard
of
they
came
to
meet
us
as
far
as
appii
and
the
three
whom
when
paul
he
thanked
and
took
and
when
we
came
to
the
centurion
delivered
the
prisoners
to
the
captain
of
the
but
paul
was
suffered
to
dwell
by
himself
with
a
soldier
that
kept
and
it
came
to
that
after
three
days
paul
called
the
chief
of
the
jews
and
when
they
were
come
he
said
unto
men
though
i
have
committed
nothing
against
the
or
customs
of
our
yet
was
i
delivered
prisoner
from
jerusalem
into
the
hands
of
the
when
they
had
examined
would
have
let
because
there
was
no
cause
of
death
in
but
when
the
jews
spake
against
i
was
constrained
to
appeal
unto
not
that
i
had
ought
to
accuse
my
nation
for
this
cause
therefore
have
i
called
for
to
see
and
to
speak
with
because
that
for
the
hope
of
israel
i
am
bound
with
this
and
they
said
unto
we
neither
received
letters
out
of
judaea
concerning
neither
any
of
the
brethren
that
came
shewed
or
spake
any
harm
of
but
we
desire
to
hear
of
thee
what
thou
for
as
concerning
this
we
know
that
every
where
it
is
spoken
and
when
they
had
appointed
him
a
there
came
many
to
him
into
to
whom
he
expounded
and
testified
the
kingdom
of
persuading
them
concerning
both
out
of
the
law
of
and
the
from
morning
till
and
some
believed
the
things
which
were
and
some
believed
and
when
they
agreed
not
among
they
after
that
paul
had
spoken
one
well
spake
the
holy
ghost
by
esaias
the
prophet
unto
our
go
unto
this
and
hearing
ye
shall
and
shall
not
and
seeing
ye
shall
and
not
for
the
heart
of
this
people
is
waxed
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
and
their
eyes
have
they
lest
they
should
see
with
and
hear
with
and
understand
with
and
should
be
and
i
should
heal
be
it
known
therefore
unto
that
the
salvation
of
god
is
sent
unto
the
and
they
will
hear
and
when
he
had
said
these
the
jews
and
had
great
reasoning
among
and
paul
dwelt
two
whole
years
in
his
own
hired
and
received
all
that
came
in
unto
preaching
the
kingdom
of
and
teaching
those
things
which
concern
the
lord
jesus
with
all
no
man
forbidding
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
romans
chapter
a
servant
of
jesus
called
an
separated
unto
the
gospel
of
he
had

was
let
that
i
might
have
some
fruit
among

even
as
among
other
i
am
debtor
both
to

and
to
the
both
to

and
to
the
as
much
as
in
me
i
am
ready
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
that
are
at
rome
for
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
gospel
of
for
it
is
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
to
the
jew
and
also
to
the
for
therein
is
the
righteousness
of
god
revealed
from
faith
to
as
it
is
the
just
shall
live
by
for
the
wrath
of
god
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
who
hold
the
truth
in
because
that
which
may
be
known
of
god
is
manifest
in
for
god
hath
shewed
unto
for
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
his
eternal
power
and
so
that
they
are
without
because
when
they
knew
they
glorified
not
as
neither
were
but
became
vain
in
their
and
their
foolish
heart
was
professing
themselves
to
be
they
became
and
changed
the
glory
of
the
uncorruptible
god
into
an
image
made
like
to
corruptible
and
to
and
fourfooted
and
creeping
wherefore
god
also
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
through
the
lusts
of
their
own
to
dishonour
their
own
bodies
between
who
changed
the
truth
of
god
into
a
and
worshipped
and
served
the
creature
more
than
the
who
is
blessed
for
for
this
cause
god
gave
them
up
unto
vile
for
even
their
women
did
change
the
natural
use
into
that
which
is
against
and
likewise
also
the
leaving
the
natural
use
of
the
burned
in
their
lust
one
toward
men
with
men
working
that
which
is
and
receiving
in
themselves
that
recompence
of
their
error
which
was
and
even
as
they
did
not
like
to
retain
god
in
god
gave
them
over
to
a
reprobate
to
do
those
things
which
are
not
being
filled
with
all
full
of
haters
of
inventors
of
evil
disobedient
to
without
without
natural
who
knowing
the
judgment
of
that
they
which
commit
such
things
are
worthy
of
not
only
do
the

have
pleasure
in
them
that

therefore
thou
art
o
whosoever
thou
art
that
for
wherein
thou
judgest
thou
condemnest
for
thou
that
judgest
doest
the

we
are
sure
that
the
judgment
of
god
is
according
to
truth
against
them
which
commit
such

thinkest
thou
o

such

doest

thou
shalt
escape

despisest
thou
the

forbearance

not

that
the
goodness
of
god
leadeth
thee
to

after
thy
hardness
and
impenitent
heart
treasurest
up
unto
thyself
wrath
against
the

unto
them
that

obey

upon

blasphemed
among

gentiles
through
as
it
is
for
circumcision
verily
if
thou
keep
the
but
if
thou
be
a
breaker
of

thy
circumcision
is
made
therefore
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
and
shall
not
uncircumcision
which
is
by
if
it
fulfil
the
judge
who
by
the
letter
and
circumcision
dost
transgress
the
for
he
is
not
a
which
is
one
neither
which
is
outward
in

but
he
a
which
is
one
and
circumcision
of
the
in
the
not
in
the
whose
praise
not
of
but
of
chapter
what
advantage
then
hath
the
or
what
profit
of
much
every
because
that
unto
them
were
committed
the
oracles
of
for
what
if
some
did
not
shall
their
unbelief
make
the
faith
of
god
without
god
let
god
be
but
every
man
a
as
it
is
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
in
thy
and
mightest
overcome
when
thou
art
but
if
our
unrighteousness
commend
the
righteousness
of
what
shall
we
god
unrighteous
who
taketh
speak
as
a
god
for
then
how
shall
god
judge
the
for
if
the
truth
of
god
hath
more
abounded
through
my
lie
unto
his
why
yet
am
i
also
judged
as
a
and
not
we
be
slanderously
and
as
some
affirm
that
we
let
us
do
that
good
may
whose
damnation
is
what
are
we
better
in
no
for
we
have
before
proved
both
jews
and
that
they
are
all
under
as
it
is
there
is
none
not
there
is
none
that
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
they
are
all
gone
out
of
the
they
are
together
become
there
is
none
that
doeth
not
their
throat
an
open
with
their
tongues
they
have
used
the
poison
of
asps
under
their
whose
mouth
full
of
cursing
and
their
feet
swift
to
shed
destruction
and
misery
in
their
and
the
way
of
peace
have
they
not
there
is
no
fear
of
god
before
their
now
we
know
that
what
things
soever
the
law
it
saith
to
them
who
are
under
the
that
every
mouth
may
be
and
all
the
world
may
become
guilty
before
therefore
by
the
deeds
of
the
law
there
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
in
his
for
by
the
law
the
knowledge
of
but
now
the
righteousness
of
god
without
the
law
is
being
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
even
the
righteousness
of
god
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
unto
all
and
upon
all
them
that
for
there
is
no
for
all
have
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
whom
god
hath
set
forth
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
through
the
forbearance
of
to
at
this
time
his
that
he
might
be
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
where
boasting
it
is
by
what
of
but
by
the
law
of
therefore
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
the
god
of
the
jews
not
also
of
the
of
the
gentiles
seeing
one
which
shall
justify
the
circumcision
by
and
uncircumcision
through
do
we
then
make
void
the
law
through
god
we
establish
the
chapter
what
shall
we
say
then
that
abraham
our
as
pertaining
to
the
hath
for
if
abraham
were
justified
by
he
hath
to
but
not
before
for
what
saith
the
abraham
believed
and
it
was
counted
unto
him
for
now
to
him
that
worketh
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
but
of
but
to
him
that
worketh
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
his
faith
is
counted
for
even
as
david
also
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
unto
whom
god
imputeth
righteousness
without
blessed
they
whose
iniquities
are
and
whose
sins
are
blessed
the
man
to
whom
the
lord
will
not
impute
this
blessedness
then
upon
the
circumcision
or
upon
the
uncircumcision
for
we
say
that
faith
was
reckoned
to
abraham
for
how
was
it
then
when
he
was
in
or
in
not
in
but
in
and
he
received
the
sign
of
a
seal
of
the
righteousness
of
the
faith
which
had
being
that
he
might
be
the
father
of
all
them
that
though
they
be
not
that
righteousness
might
be
imputed
unto
them
and
the
father
of
circumcision
to
them
who
are
not
of
the
circumcision
but
who
also
walk
in
the
steps
of
that
faith
of
our
father
which
being
for
the
that
he
should
be
the
heir
of
the
not
to
or
to
his
through
the
but
through
the
righteousness
of
for
if
they
which
are
of
the
law
faith
is
made
and
the
promise
made
of
none
because
the
law
worketh
for
where
no
law
no
therefore
of
that
might
by
to
the
end
the
promise
might
be
sure
to
all
the
not
to
that
only
which
is
of
the
but
to
that
also
which
is
of
the
faith
of
who
is
the
father
of
us
it
is
i
have
made
thee
a
father
of
many
before
him
whom
he
who
quickeneth
the
and
calleth
those
things
which
be
not
as
though
they
who
against
hope
believed
in
that
he
might
become
the
father
of
many
according
to
that
which
was
so
shall
thy
seed
and
being
not
weak
in
he
considered
not
his
own
body
now
when
he
was
about
an
hundred
years
neither
yet
the
deadness
of
he
staggered
not
at
the
promise
of
god
through
but
was
strong
in
giving
glory
to
and
being
fully
persuaded
what
he
had
he
was
able
also
to
and
therefore
it
was
imputed
to
him
for
now
it
was
not
written
for
his
sake
that
it
was
imputed
to
but
for
us
to
whom
it
shall
be
if
we
believe
on
him
that
raised
up
jesus
our
lord
from
the
who
was
delivered
for
our
and
was
raised
again
for
our
chapter
therefore
being
justified
by
we
have
peace
with
god
through
our
lord
jesus
by
whom
also
we
have
access
by
faith
into
this
grace
wherein
we
and
rejoice
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
and
not
only
but
we
glory
in
tribulations
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
and
and
and
hope
maketh
not
because
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
holy
ghost
which
is
given
unto
for
when
we
were
yet
without
in
due
time
christ
died
for
the
for
scarcely
for
a
righteous
man
will
one
yet
peradventure
for
a
good
man
some
would
even
dare
to
but
god
commendeth
his
love
toward
in
while
we
were
yet
christ
died
for
much
more
being
now
justified
by
his
we
shall
be
saved
from
wrath
through
for
when
we
were
we
were
reconciled
to
god
by
the
death
of
his
much
being
we
shall
be
saved
by
his
and
not
only
but
we
also
joy
in
god
through
our
lord
jesus
by
whom
we
have
now
received
the
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
and
death
by
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
for
that
all
have
until
the
law
sin
was
in
the
but
sin
is
not
imputed
when
there
is
no
nevertheless
death
reigned
from
adam
to
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
who
is
the
figure
of
him
that
was
to
but
not
as
the
so
also
the
free
for
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
much
more
the
grace
of
and
the
gift
by
by
one
jesus
hath
abounded
unto
and
not
as
by
one
that
the
for
the
judgment
by
one
to
but
the
free
gift
of
many
offences
unto
for
if
by
one
offence
death
reigned
by
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righteousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
jesus
therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
upon
all
men
to
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
free
gift
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
for
as
by
one
disobedience
many
were
made
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
moreover
the
law
that
the
offence
might
but
where
sin
grace
did
much
more
that
as
sin
hath
reigned
unto
even
so
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
by
jesus
christ
our
chapter
what
shall
we
say
shall
we
continue
in
that
grace
may
god
how
shall
that
are
dead
to
live
any
longer
know
ye
that
so
many
of
us
as
were
baptized
into
jesus
christ
were
baptized
into
his
therefore
we
are
buried
with
him
by
baptism
into
that
like
as
christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glory
of
the
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
for
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
we
shall
be
also
the
of
knowing
that
our
old
man
is
crucified
with
that
the
body
of
sin
might
be
that
henceforth
we
should
not
serve
for
he
that
is
dead
is
freed
from
now
if
we
be
dead
with
we
believe
that
we
shall
also
live
with
knowing
that
christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
no
death
hath
no
more
dominion
over
for
in
that
he
he
died
unto
sin
but
in
that
he
he
liveth
unto
likewise
reckon
ye
also
yourselves
to
be
dead
indeed
unto
but
alive
unto
god
through
jesus
christ
our
let
not
sin
therefore
reign
in
your
mortal
that
ye
should
obey
it
in
the
lusts
neither
yield
ye
your
members
instruments
of
unrighteousness
unto
but
yield
yourselves
unto
as
those
that
are
alive
from
the
and
your
members
instruments
of
righteousness
unto
for
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
for
ye
are
not
under
the
but
under
what
shall
we
because
we
are
not
under
the
but
under
god
know
ye
that
to
whom
ye
yield
yourselves
servants
to
his
servants
ye
are
to
whom
ye
whether
of
sin
unto
or
of
obedience
unto
but
god
be
that
ye
were
the
servants
of
but
ye
have
obeyed
from
the
heart
that
form
of
doctrine
which
was
delivered
being
then
made
free
from
ye
became
the
servants
of
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
because
of
the
infirmity
of
your
for
as
ye
have
yielded
your
members
servants
to
uncleanness
and
to
iniquity
unto
even
so
now
yield
your
members
servants
to
righteousness
unto
for
when
ye
were
the
servants
of
ye
were
free
from
what
fruit
had
ye
then
in
those
things
whereof
ye
are
now
for
the
end
of
those
things
but
now
being
made
free
from
and
become
servants
to
ye
have
your
fruit
unto
and
the
end
everlasting
for
the
wages
of
sin
but
the
gift
of
god
eternal
life
through
jesus
christ
our
chapter
know
ye
i
speak
to
them
that
know
the
how
that
the
law
hath
dominion
over
a
man
as
long
as
he
for
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
is
bound
by
the
law
to
husband
so
long
as
he
but
if
the
husband
be
she
is
loosed
from
the
law
of
so
then
while
husband
she
be
married
to
another
she
shall
be
called
an
but
if
her
husband
be
she
is
free
from
that
so
that
she
is
no
though
she
be
married
to
another
my
ye
also
are
become
dead
to
the
law
by
the
body
of
that
ye
should
be
married
to
to
him
who
is
raised
from
the
that
we
should
bring
forth
fruit
unto
for
when
we
were
in
the
the
motions
of
which
were
by
the
did
work
in
our
members
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto
but
now
we
are
delivered
from
the
that
being
dead
wherein
we
were
that
we
should
serve
in
newness
of
and
not
the
oldness
of
the
what
shall
we
say
the
law
god
i
had
not
known
but
by
the
for
i
had
not
known
except
the
law
had
thou
shalt
not
but
taking
occasion
by
the
wrought
in
me
all
manner
of
for
without
the
law
sin
for
i
was
alive
without
the
law
but
when
the
commandment
sin
and
i
and
the
which
to
i
found
unto
for
taking
occasion
by
the
deceived
and
by
it
slew
wherefore
the
law
and
the
commandment
and
and
was
then
that
which
is
good
made
death
unto
god
but
that
it
might
appear
working
death
in
me
by
that
which
is
that
sin
by
the
commandment
might
become
exceeding
for
we
know
that
the
law
is
but
i
am
sold
under
for
that
which
i
do
i
allow
for
what
i
that
do
i
but
what
i
that
do
if
then
i
do
that
which
i
would
i
consent
unto
the
law
that
now
then
it
is
no
more
i
that
do
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
for
i
know
that
in
me
in
my
dwelleth
no
good
for
to
will
is
present
with
but
to
perform
that
which
is
good
i
find
for
the
good
that
i
would
i
do
but
the
evil
which
i
would
that
i
now
if
i
do
that
i
would
it
is
no
more
i
that
do
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
i
find
then
a
when
i
would
do
evil
is
present
with
for
i
delight
in
the
law
of
god
after
the
inward
but
i
see
another
law
in
my
warring
against
the
law
of
my
and
bringing
me
into
captivity
to
the
law
of
sin
which
is
in
my
o
wretched
man
that
i
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
i
thank
god
through
jesus
christ
our
so
then
with
the
mind
i
myself
serve
the
law
of
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
of
chapter
therefore
now
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
christ
who
walk
not
after
the
but
after
the
for
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
life
in
christ
jesus
hath
made
me
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
for
what
the
law
could
not
in
that
it
was
weak
through
the
god
sending
his
own
son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
and
for
condemned
sin
in
the
that
the
righteousness
of
the
law
might
be
fulfilled
in
who
walk
not
after
the
but
after
the
for
they
that
are
after
the
flesh
do
mind
the
things
of
the
but
they
that
are
after
the
spirit
the
things
of
the
for
to
be
carnally
minded
but
to
be
spiritually
minded
life
and
because
the
carnal
mind
enmity
against
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
neither
indeed
can
so
then
they
that
are
in
the
flesh
cannot
please
but
ye
are
not
in
the
but
in
the
if
so
be
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwell
in
now
if
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
he
is
none
of
and
if
christ
in
the
body
dead
because
of
but
the
spirit
life
because
of
but
if
the
spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
jesus
from
the
dead
dwell
in
he
that
raised
up
christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
we
are
not
to
the
to
live
after
the
for
if
ye
live
after
the
ye
shall
but
if
ye
through
the
spirit
do
mortify
the
deeds
of
the
ye
shall
for
as
many
as
are
led
by
the
spirit
of
they
are
the
sons
of
for
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
whereby
we
the
spirit
itself
beareth
witness
with
our
that
we
are
the
children
of
and
if
then
heirs
of
and
with
if
so
be
that
we
suffer
with
that
we
may
be
also
glorified
for
i
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
not
worthy
be
with
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
in
for
the
earnest
expectation
of
the
creature
waiteth
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
for
the
creature
was
made
subject
to
not
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected
in
because
the
creature
itself
also
shall
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
for
we
know
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
together
until
and
not
only
but
ourselves
which
have
the
firstfruits
of
the
even
we
ourselves
groan
within
waiting
for
the
the
redemption
of
our
for
we
are
saved
by
but
hope
that
is
seen
is
not
for
what
a
man
why
doth
he
yet
hope
but
if
we
hope
for
that
we
see
do
we
with
patience
wait
for
likewise
the
spirit
also
helpeth
our
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
cannot
be
and
he
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
the
mind
of
the
because
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
will
and
we
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
to
them
who
are
the
called
according
to
for
whom
he
did
he
also
did
predestinate
conformed
to
the
image
of
his
that
he
might
be
the
firstborn
among
many
moreover
whom
he
did
them
he
also
and
whom
he
them
he
also
and
whom
he
them
he
also
what
shall
we
then
say
to
these
if
god
for
who
against
he
that
spared
not
his
own
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
how
shall
he
not
with
him
also
freely
give
us
all
who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
god
that
who
he
that
christ
that
yea
that
is
risen
who
is
even
at
the
right
hand
of
who
also
maketh
intercession
for
who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
or
or
or
or
or
or
as
it
is
for
thy
sake
we
are
killed
all
the
day
we
are
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
in
all
these
things
we
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
for
i
am
that
neither
nor
nor
nor
nor
nor
things
nor
things
to
nor
nor
nor
any
other
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
chapter
i
say
the
truth
in
i
lie
my
conscience
also
bearing
me
witness
in
the
holy
that
i
have
great
heaviness
and
continual
sorrow
in
my
for
i
could
wish
that
myself
were
accursed
from
christ
for
my
my
kinsmen
according
to
the
who
are
to

as
concerning
the

christ
who
is
over
god
blessed
for
not
as
though
the
word
of
god
hath
taken
none
for
they
not
all
which
are
of

they
are
the
seed
of
all

thy
seed
be
that
they
which

not
the
children

the
children
of

this
time

when

also
had
conceived
by
by
our
father

done
any
good

that
the

but
esau

saith
to
i
will
have
mercy
on
whom
i
will
have
and
i
will
have
compassion
on
whom
i
will

then
not
of

of

for
the
scripture

unto
even
for
this

i
raised
thee
that
i
might

her
which
was
not

place
where
it
was
said
unto

there
shall
they
be
called
the
children
of
the
living
esaias
also
crieth
concerning
though
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
a
remnant
shall
be
for
he
will
finish
the
and
cut
short
in
because
a
short
work
will
the
lord
make
upon
the
and
as
esaias
said
except
the
lord
of
sabaoth
had
left
us
a
we
had
been
as
and
been
made
like
unto
what
shall
we
say
that
the
which
followed
not
after
have
attained
to
even
the
righteousness
which
is
of
but
which
followed
after
the
law
of
hath
not
attained
to
the
law
of
because
sought
not
by
but
as
it
were
by
the
works
of
the
for
they
stumbled
at
that
as
it
is
i
lay
in
sion
a
stumblingstone
and
rock
of
and
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
chapter
my
desire
and
prayer
to
god
for
israel
that
they
might
be
for
i
bear
them
record
that
they
have
a
zeal
of
but
not
according
to
for
they
being
ignorant
of
and
going
about
to
establish
their
own
have
not
submitted
themselves
unto
the
righteousness
of
for
christ
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
for
moses
describeth
the
righteousness
which
is
of
the
that
the
man
which
doeth
those
things
shall
live
by
but
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
speaketh
on
this
say
not
in
thine
who
shall
ascend
into
to
bring
christ
down
who
shall
descend
into
the
to
bring
up
christ
again
from
the
but
what
saith
the
word
is
nigh
in
thy
and
in
thy
that
the
word
of
which
we
that
if
thou
shalt
confess
with
thy
mouth
the
lord
and
shalt
believe
in
thine
heart
that
god
hath
raised
him
from
the
thou
shalt
be
for
with
the
heart
man
believeth
unto
and
with
the
mouth
confession
is
made
unto
for
the
scripture
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
for
there
is
no
difference
between
the
jew
and
the
for
the
same
lord
over
all
is
rich
unto
all
that
call
upon
for
whosoever
shall
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
how
then
shall
they
call
on
him
in
whom
they
have
not
and
how
shall
they
believe
in
him
of
whom
they
have
not
and
how
shall
they
hear
without
a
and
how
shall
they
except
they
be
as
it
is
how
beautiful
are
the
feet
of
them
that
preach
the
gospel
of
and
bring
glad
tidings
of
good
but
they
have
not
all
obeyed
the
for
esaias
who
hath
believed
our
so
then
faith
by
and
hearing
by
the
word
of
but
i
have
they
not
yes
their
sound
went
into
all
the
and
their
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
but
i
did
not
israel
first
moses
i
will
provoke
you
to
jealousy
by
that
no
by
a
foolish
nation
i
will
anger
but
esaias
is
very
and
i
was
found
of
them
that
sought
me
i
was
made
manifest
unto
them
that
asked
not
after
but
to
israel
he
all
day
long
i
have
stretched
forth
my
hands
unto
a
disobedient
and
gainsaying
chapter
i
say
hath
god
cast
away
his
god
for
i
also
am
an
of
the
seed
of
the
tribe
of
god
hath
not
cast
away
his
people
which
he
wot
ye
not
what
the
scripture
saith
of
how
he
maketh
intercession
to
god
against
they
have
killed
thy
and
digged
down
thine
and
i
am
left
and
they
seek
my
but
what
saith
the
answer
of
god
unto
i
have
reserved
to
myself
seven
thousand
who
have
not
bowed
the
knee
to
image
even
so
then
at
this
present
time
also
there
is
a
remnant
according
to
the
election
of
and
if
by
then
no
more
of
otherwise
grace
is
no
more
but
if
of
then
is
it
no
more
otherwise
work
is
no
more
what
israel
hath
not
obtained
that
which
he
seeketh
but
the
election
hath
obtained
and
the
rest
were
blinded
as
it
is
god
hath
given
them
the
spirit
of
eyes
that
they
should
not
and
ears
that
they
should
not
unto
this
and
david
let
their
table
be
made
a
and
a
and
a
and
a
recompence
unto
let
their
eyes
be
that
they
may
not
and
bow
down
their
back
i
say
have
they
stumbled
that
they
should
god
but
through
their
fall
salvation
unto
the
for
to
provoke
them
to
now
if
the
fall
of

riches
of

the
diminishing
of
them
the
riches
of

much
more

for
i
speak
to
you
inasmuch
as
i
am
the
apostle
of
the

magnify
mine
if
by
any
means
i
may
provoke
to
emulation
which
my
and
might
save
some
of

if
the
casting
away
of
them
the
reconciling
of
the

as
christ
also
received
us
to
the
glory
of
now
i
say
that
jesus
christ
was
a
minister
of
the
circumcision
for
the
truth
of
to
confirm
the
promises
unto
the
and
that
the
gentiles
might
glorify
god
for
as
it
is
for
this
cause
i
will
confess
to
thee
among
the
and
sing
unto
thy
and
again
he
ye
with
his
and
praise
the
all
ye
and
laud
all
ye
and

a
root
of

rise
to
reign
over

the
gentiles
now
the
god
of
hope
fill
you
with
all
joy
and
peace
in
that
ye
may
abound
in
through
the
power
of
the
holy
and
i
myself
also
am
persuaded
of
my
that
ye
also
are
full
of
filled
with
all
able
also
to
admonish
one
i
have
written
the
more
boldly
unto
you
in
some
as
putting
you
in
because
of
the
grace
that
is
given
to
me
of
that
i
should
be
the
minister
of
jesus
christ
to
the
ministering
the
gospel
of
that
the
offering
up
of
the
gentiles
might
be
being
sanctified
by
the
holy
i
have
therefore
whereof
i
may
glory
through
jesus
christ
in
those
things
which
pertain
to
for
i
will
not
dare
to
speak
of
any
of
those
things
which
christ
hath
not
wrought
by
to
make
the
gentiles
by
word
and
through
mighty
signs
and
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
of
so
that
from

round
about

have
fully
preached
the
gospel
of
so
have
i
strived
to
preach
the
not
where
christ
was

i
should
build
upon
another

as
it
is
to
whom
he
was
not
spoken
they
shall
and
they
that
have
not
heard
shall
for
which
cause
also
i
have
been
much
hindered

no
more

a
great

the
greeks
seek
after
but
we
preach
christ
unto
the
jews
a
and
unto
the
greeks
but
unto
them
which
are
both
jews
and
christ
the
power
of
and
the
wisdom
of
because
the
foolishness
of
god
is
wiser
than
and
the
weakness
of
god
is
stronger
than
for
ye
see
your
how
that
not
many
wise
men
after
the
not
many
not
many
but
god
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
and
god
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
and
base
things
of
the
and
things
which
are
hath
god
and
things
which
are
to
bring
to
nought
things
that
that
no
flesh
should
glory
in
his
but
of
him
are
ye
in
christ
who
of
god
is
made
unto
us
and
and
and
according
as
it
is
he
that
let
him
glory
in
the
chapter
and
when
i
came
to
came
not
with
excellency
of
speech
or
of
declaring
unto
you
the
testimony
of
for
i
determined
not
to
know
any
thing
among
save
jesus
and
him
and
i
was
with
you
in
and
in
and
in
much
and
my
speech
and
my
preaching
not
with
enticing
words
of
but
in
demonstration
of
the
spirit
and
of
that
your
faith
should
not
stand
in
the
wisdom
of
but
in
the
power
of
howbeit
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
nor
of
the
princes
of
this
that
come
to
but
we
speak
the
wisdom
of
god
in
a
the
hidden
which
god
ordained
before
the
world
unto
our
which
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
for
had
they
known
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
lord
of
but
as
it
is
eye
hath
not
nor
ear
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
the
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
but
god
hath
revealed
unto
us
by
his
for
the
spirit
searcheth
all
the
deep
things
of
for
what
man
knoweth
the
things
of
a
save
the
spirit
of
man
which
is
in
even
so
the
things
of
god
knoweth
no
but
the
spirit
of
now
we
have
not
the
spirit
of
the
but
the
spirit
which
is
of
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
are
freely
given
to
us
of
which
things
also
we
not
in
the
words
which
wisdom
but
which
the
holy
ghost
comparing
spiritual
things
with
but
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
neither
can
he
know
because
they
are
spiritually
but
he
that
is
spiritual
judgeth
all
yet
he
himself
is
judged
of
no
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
that
he
may
instruct
but
we
have
the
mind
of
chapter
and
could
not
speak
unto
you
as
unto
but
as
unto
as
unto
babes
in
i
have
fed
you
with
and
not
with
for
hitherto
ye
were
not
able
bear
neither
yet
now
are
ye
for
ye
are
yet
for
whereas
among
you
and
and
are
ye
not
and
walk
as
for
while
one
i
am
of
and
i
of
are
ye
not
who
then
is
and
who
but
ministers
by
whom
ye
even
as
the
lord
gave
to
every
i
have
apollos
but
god
gave
the
so
then
neither
is
he
that
planteth
any
neither
he
that
but
god
that
giveth
the
now
he
that
planteth
and
he
that
watereth
are
and
every
man
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
for
we
are
labourers
together
with
ye
are
according
to
the
grace
of
god
which
is
given
unto
as
a
wise
i
have
laid
the
and
another
buildeth
but
let
every
man
take
heed
how
he
buildeth
for
other
foundation
can
no
man
lay
than
that
is
which
is
jesus
now
if
any
man
build
upon
this
foundation
precious
every
work
shall
be
made
for
the
day
shall
declare
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
work
of
what
sort
it
if
any
work
abide
which
he
hath
built
he
shall
receive
a
if
any
work
shall
be
he
shall
suffer
but
he
himself
shall
be
yet
so
as
by
know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
and
the
spirit
of
god
dwelleth
in
if
any
man
defile
the
temple
of
him
shall
god
for
the
temple
of
god
is
which
ye
let
no
man
deceive
if
any
man
among
you
seemeth
to
be
wise
in
this
let
him
become
a
that
he
may
be
for
the
wisdom
of
this
world
is
foolishness
with
for
it
is
he
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
and
the
lord
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
the
that
they
are
therefore
let
no
man
glory
in
for
all
things
are
whether
or
or
or
the
or
or
or
things
or
things
to
all
are
and
ye
are
and
christ
chapter
let
a
man
so
account
of
as
of
the
ministers
of
and
stewards
of
the
mysteries
of
moreover
it
is
required
in
that
a
man
be
found
but
with
me
it
is
a
very
small
thing
that
i
should
be
judged
of
or
of
i
judge
not
mine
own
for
i
know
nothing
by
yet
am
i
not
hereby
but
he
that
judgeth
me
is
the
therefore
judge
nothing
before
the
until
the
lord
who
both
will
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
and
will
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
and
then
shall
every
man
have
praise
of
and
these
i
have
in
a
figure
transferred
to
myself
and
apollos
for
your
that
ye
might
learn
in
us
not
to
think
above
that
which
is
that
no
one
of
you
be
puffed
up
for
one
against
for
who
maketh
thee
to
differ
and
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
now
if
thou
didst
receive
why
dost
thou
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
now
ye
are
now
ye
are
ye
have
reigned
as
kings
without
and
i
would
to
god
ye
did
that
we
also
might
reign
with
for
i
think
that
god
hath
set
forth
us
the
apostles
as
it
were
appointed
to
for
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
the
and
to
and
to
we
fools
for
but
ye
wise
in
we
but
ye
ye
but
we
even
unto
this
present
hour
we
both
and
and
are
and
are
and
have
no
certain
and
working
with
our
own
being
we
being
we
suffer
being
we
we
are
made
as
the
filth
of
the
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
i
write
not
these
things
to
shame
but
as
my
beloved
sons
i
warn
for
though
ye
have
ten
thousand
instructors
in
yet
not
many
for
in
christ
jesus
i
have
begotten
you
through
the
wherefore
i
beseech
be
ye
followers
of
for
this
cause
have
i
sent
unto
you
who
is
my
beloved
and
faithful
in
the
who
shall
bring
you
into
remembrance
of
my
ways
which
be
in
as
i
teach
every
where
in
every
now
some
are
puffed
as
though
i
would
not
come
to
but
i
will
come
to
you
if
the
lord
and
will
not
the
speech
of
them
which
are
puffed
but
the
for
the
kingdom
of
god
not
in
but
in
what
will
shall
i
come
unto
you
with
a
or
in
and
the
spirit
of
chapter
it
is
reported
commonly
there
fornication
among
and
such
fornication
as
is
not
so
much
as
named
among
the
that
one
should
have
his
and
ye
are
puffed
and
have
not
rather
that
he
that
hath
done
this
deed
might
be
taken
away
from
among
for
i
as
absent
in
but
present
in
have
judged
as
though
i
were
him
that
hath
so
done
this
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
when
ye
are
gathered
and
my
with
the
power
of
our
lord
jesus
to
deliver
such
an
one
unto
satan
for
the
destruction
of
the
that
the
spirit
may
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
lord
your
glorying
not
know
ye
not
that
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
purge
out
therefore
the
old
that
ye
may
be
a
new
as
ye
are
for
even
christ
our
passover
is
sacrificed
for
therefore
let
us
keep
the
not
with
old
neither
with
the
leaven
of
malice
and
but
with
the
unleavened
of
sincerity
and
i
wrote
unto
you
in
an
epistle
not
to
company
with
yet
not
altogether
with
the
fornicators
of
this
or
with
the
or
or
with
for
then
must
ye
needs
go
out
of
the
but
now
i
have
written
unto
you
not
to
keep
if
any
man
that
is
called
a
brother
be
a
or
or
an
or
a
or
a
or
an
with
such
an
one
no
not
to
for
what
have
i
to
do
to
judge
them
also
that
are
do
not
ye
judge
them
that
are
but
them
that
are
without
god
therefore
put
away
from
among
yourselves
that
wicked
chapter
dare
any
of
having
a
matter
against
go
to
law
before
the
and
not
before
the
do
ye
not
know
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the
and
if
the
world
shall
be
judged
by
are
ye
unworthy
to
judge
the
smallest
know
ye
not
that
we
shall
judge
how
much
more
things
that
pertain
to
this
if
then
ye
have
judgments
of
things
pertaining
to
this
set
them
to
judge
who
are
least
esteemed
in
the
i
speak
to
your
is
it
that
there
is
not
a
wise
man
among
not
one
that
shall
be
able
to
judge
between
his
but
brother
goeth
to
law
with
and
that
before
the
now
therefore
there
is
utterly
a
fault
among
because
ye
go
to
law
one
with
why
do
ye
not
rather
take
why
do
ye
not
rather
yourselves
be
ye
do
and
and
that
know
ye
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
be
not
neither
nor
nor
nor
nor
abusers
of
themselves
with
nor
nor
nor
nor
nor
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
and
such
were
some
of
but
ye
are
but
ye
are
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
by
the
spirit
of
our
all
things
are
lawful
unto
but
all
things
are
not
all
things
are
lawful
for
but
i
will
not
be
brought
under
the
power
of
meats
for
the
and
the
belly
for
but
god
shall
destroy
both
it
and
now
the
body
not
for
but
for
the
and
the
lord
for
the
and
god
hath
both
raised
up
the
and
will
also
raise
up
us
by
his
own
know
ye
not
that
your
bodies
are
the
members
of
shall
i
then
take
the
members
of
and
make
the
members
of
an
god
know
ye
not
that
he
which
is
joined
to
an
harlot
is
one
for
saith
shall
be
one
but
he
that
is
joined
unto
the
lord
is
one
flee
every
sin
that
a
man
doeth
is
without
the
but
he
that
committeth
fornication
sinneth
against
his
own
know
ye
not
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
in
which
ye
have
of
and
ye
are
not
your
for
ye
are
bought
with
a
therefore
glorify
god
in
your
and
in
your
which
are
chapter
now
concerning
the
things
whereof
ye
wrote
unto
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
let
every
man
have
his
own
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
let
the
husband
render
unto
the
wife
due
and
likewise
also
the
wife
unto
the
the
wife
hath
not
power
of
her
own
but
the
and
likewise
also
the
husband
hath
not
power
of
his
own
but
the
defraud
ye
not
one
the
except
with
consent
for
a
that
ye
may
give
yourselves
to
fasting
and
and
come
together
that
satan
tempt
you
not
for
your
but
i
speak
this
by
not
of
for
i
would
that
all
men
were
even
as
i
but
every
man
hath
his
proper
gift
of
one
after
this
and
another
after
i
say
therefore
to
the
unmarried
and
it
is
good
for
them
if
they
abide
even
as
but
if
they
cannot
let
them
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
and
unto
the
married
i
not
but
the
let
not
the
wife
depart
from
but
and
if
she
let
her
remain
or
be
reconciled
to
and
let
not
the
husband
put
away
but
to
the
rest
speak
not
the
if
any
brother
hath
a
wife
that
believeth
and
she
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
let
him
not
put
her
and
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
that
believeth
and
if
he
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
let
her
not
leave
for
the
unbelieving
husband
is
sanctified
by
the
and
the
unbelieving
wife
is
sanctified
by
the
else
were
your
children
but
now
are
they
but
if
the
unbelieving
let
him
a
brother
or
a
sister
is
not
under
bondage
in
such
but
god
hath
called
us
to
for
what
knowest
o
whether
thou
shalt
save
or
how
knowest
o
whether
thou
shalt
save
but
as
god
hath
distributed
to
every
as
the
lord
hath
called
every
so
let
him
and
so
ordain
i
in
all
is
any
man
called
being
let
him
not
become
is
any
called
in
let
him
not
be
circumcision
is
and
uncircumcision
is
but
the
keeping
of
the
commandments
of
let
every
man
abide
in
the
same
calling
wherein
he
was
art
thou
called
a
care
not
for
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
use
for
he
that
is
called
in
the
a
is
the
likewise
also
he
that
is
is
ye
are
bought
with
a
be
not
ye
the
servants
of
let
every
wherein
he
is
therein
abide
with
now
concerning
virgins
i
have
no
commandment
of
the
yet
i
give
my
as
one
that
hath
obtained
mercy
of
the
lord
to
be
i
suppose
therefore
that
this
is
good
for
the
present
that
good
for
a
man
so
to
art
thou
bound
unto
a
seek
not
to
be
art
thou
loosed
from
a
seek
not
a
but
and
if
thou
thou
hast
not
and
if
a
virgin
she
hath
not
nevertheless
such
shall
have
trouble
in
the
but
i
spare
but
this
i
the
time
it
that
both
they
that
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
and
they
that
as
though
they
wept
and
they
that
as
though
they
rejoiced
and
they
that
as
though
they
possessed
and
they
that
use
this
as
not
abusing
for
the
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
but
i
would
have
you
without
he
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
how
he
may
please
the
but
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
how
he
may
please
there
is
difference
between
a
wife
and
a
the
unmarried
woman
careth
for
the
things
of
the
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
but
she
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
how
she
may
please
and
this
i
speak
for
your
own
not
that
i
may
cast
a
snare
upon
but
for
that
which
is
and
that
ye
may
attend
upon
the
lord
without
but
if
any
man
think
that
he
behaveth
himself
uncomely
toward
his
if
she
pass
the
flower
of
and
need
so
let
him
do
what
he
he
sinneth
let
them
nevertheless
he
that
standeth
stedfast
in
his
having
no
but
hath
power
over
his
own
and
hath
so
decreed
in
his
heart
that
he
will
keep
his
doeth
so
then
he
that
giveth
in
marriage
doeth
but
he
that
giveth
not
in
marriage
doeth
the
wife
is
bound
by
the
law
as
long
as
her
husband
but
if
her
husband
be
she
is
at
liberty
to
be
married
to
whom
she
only
in
the
but
she
is
happier
if
she
so
after
my
and
i
think
also
that
i
have
the
spirit
of
chapter
now
as
touching
things
offered
unto
we
know
that
we
all
have
knowledge
puffeth
but
charity
and
if
any
man
think
that
he
knoweth
any
he
knoweth
nothing
yet
as
he
ought
to
but
if
any

for
though
there
be
that

called

to
us

by

is
that
he
that

that
he
that
thresheth
in

should
be
partaker
of
his
if
we
have
sown
unto
you
spiritual
a
great
thing
if
we
shall
reap
your
carnal
if
others
be
partakers
of

we
nevertheless
we
have
not
used
this
but
suffer
all
lest
we
should
hinder
the
gospel
of
do
ye
not

that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
the
of
the
and
they
which
wait
at
the
altar
are
partakers
with
the
even
so
hath
the
lord
ordained
that
they
which
preach
the
gospel
should
live
of
the
but
i
have
used
none
of
these
neither
have
i
written
these
that
it
should
be
so
done
unto
for
better
for
me
to
than
that
any
man
should
make
my
glorying

i
preach

i
have
nothing
to

for
necessity
is
laid
upon
woe

unto
if
i
preach
not

for
if
i
do
this
thing
i
have
a
but
if
against
my
a
dispensation
the
is
committed
unto
what
is
my
reward
when
i
preach
the
i
may
make
the
gospel
of
christ
without
that
i
abuse
not
my
power
in
the

though
i
be
free
from
all
yet
have
i
made
myself

unto

therefore
so

i
keep
under
my
and
bring
into
lest
that
by
any
when
i

myself
should

chapter
i
would
not
that
ye
should
be
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
and
all
passed
through
the
and
were
all
baptized
unto
moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
and
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
rock
that
followed
and
that
rock
was
but
with
many
of
them
god
was
not
well
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
now
these
things
were
our
to
the
intent
we
should
not
lust
after
evil
as
they
also
neither
be
ye
as
some
of
as
it
is
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
and
rose
up
to
neither
let
us
commit
as
some
of
them
and
fell
in
one
day
three
and
twenty
neither
let
us
tempt
as
some
of
them
also
and
were
destroyed
of
neither
murmur
as
some
of
them
also
and
were
destroyed
of
the
now
all
these
things
happened
unto
them
for
and
they
are
written
for
our
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
world
are
wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
there
hath
no
temptation
taken
you
but
such
as
is
common
to
but
god
who
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
tempted
above
that
ye
are
but
will
with
the
temptation
also
make
a
way
to
that
ye
may
be
able
to
bear
my
dearly
flee

it
not
the

bread
which
we

not

we
many
are

we
are

partakers

of
the
what

that
the
idol

that
which
is

not

the
cup
of

cannot

not
all

every
man

ye

ye
do
all
to
the
glory
of
give
none
neither
to
the
nor
to
the
nor
to
the
church
of
even
as
i
please
all
in
all
not
seeking
mine
own
but
the
of
that
they
may
be
chapter
be
ye
followers
of
even
as
i
also
of
now
i
praise
that
ye
remember
me
in
all
and
keep
the
as
i
delivered
to
but
i
would
have
you
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
and
the
head
of
the
woman
the
and
the
head
of
christ
every
man
praying
or
having
head
dishonoureth
his
but
every
woman
that
prayeth
or
prophesieth
with
head
uncovered
dishonoureth
her
for
that
is
even
all
one
as
if
she
were
for
if
the
woman
be
not
let
her
also
be
but
if
it
be
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
be
shorn
or
let
her
be
for
a
man
indeed
ought
not
to
cover
forasmuch
as
he
is
the
image
and
glory
of
but
the
woman
is
the
glory
of
the
for
the
man
is
not
of
the
but
the
woman
of
the
neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
but
the
woman
for
the
for
this
cause
ought
the
woman
to
have
power
on
head
because
of
the
nevertheless
neither
is
the
man
without
the
neither
the
woman
without
the
in
the
for
as
the
woman
of
the
even
so
the
man
also
by
the
but
all
things
of
judge
in
is
it
comely
that
a
woman
pray
unto
god
doth
not
even
nature
itself
teach
if
a
man
have
long
it
is
a
shame
unto
but
if
a
woman
have
long
it
is
a
glory
to
for
hair
is
given
her
for
a
but
if
any
man
seem
to
be
we
have
no
such
neither
the
churches
of
now
in
this
that
i
declare
i
praise
that
ye
come
together
not
for
the
but
for
the
for
first
of
when
ye
come
together
in
the
i
hear
that
there
be
divisions
among
and
i
partly
believe
for
there
must
be
also
heresies
among
that
they
which
are
approved
may
be
made
manifest
among
when
ye
come
together
therefore
into
one
is
not
to
eat
the
for
in
eating
every
one
taketh
before
his
own
and
one
is
and
another
is
have
ye
not
houses
to
eat
and
to
drink
or
despise
ye
the
church
of
and
shame
them
that
have
what
shall
i
say
to
shall
i
praise
you
in
i
praise
for
i
have
received
of
the
lord
that
which
also
i
delivered
unto
that
the
lord
jesus
the
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
took
and
when
he
had
given
he
brake
and
this
is
my
which
is
broken
for
this
do
in
remembrance
of
after
the
same
manner
also
the
when
he
had
this
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
this
do
as
oft
as
ye
drink
in
remembrance
of
for
as
often
as
ye
eat
this
and
drink
this
ye
do
shew
the
death
till
he
wherefore
whosoever
shall
eat
this
and
drink
cup
of
the
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blood
of
the
but
let
a
man
examine
and
so
let
him
eat
of
and
drink
of
for
he
that
eateth
and
drinketh
eateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
not
discerning
the
for
this
cause
many
weak
and
sickly
among
and
many
for
if
we
would
judge
we
should
not
be
but
when
we
are
we
are
chastened
of
the
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
my
when
ye
come
together
to
tarry
one
for
and
if
any
man
let
him
eat
at
that
ye
come
not
together
unto
and
the
rest
will
i
set
in
order
when
i
chapter
now
concerning
spiritual
i
would
not
have
you
ye
know
that
ye
were
carried
away
unto
these
dumb
even
as
ye
were
wherefore
i
give
you
to
that
no
man
speaking
by
the
spirit
of
god
calleth
jesus
and
no
man
can
say
that
jesus
is
the
but
by
the
holy
now
there
are
diversities
of
but
the
same
and
there
are
differences
of
but
the
same
and
there
are
diversities
of
but
it
is
the
same
god
which
worketh
all
in
but
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
is
given
to
every
man
to
profit
for
to
one
is
given
by
the
spirit
the
word
of
to
another
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the

to
another
faith
by
the
same
to

the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
to
another
the
working
of
to
another
to
another
discerning
of
to
another
kinds
of
to
another
the
interpretation
of
but
all
these
worketh
that
one
and
the
selfsame
dividing
to
every
man
severally
as
he
for
as
the
body
is
and
hath
many
and
all
the
members
of
that
one
being
are
one
so
also
for
by
one
spirit
are
we
all
baptized
into
one
whether
jews
or
whether
bond
or
and
have
been
all
made
to
drink
into

for
the

is
not

if
the

if
they
were
all

now
many
yet

the

cannot

unto

i
have
no
need

again
the

to

have
no
need
of
much
more
those
members
of
the
which
seem
to
be
more

and
those
of
the
which
we
think
to
be
less
upon
these
we
bestow
more
abundant
and
our
uncomely
have
more
abundant
for
our
comely
have
no
but
god
hath
tempered
the
body
having
given
more
abundant
honour
to
that
which
that
there
should
be
no
schism
in
the
but
the
members
should
have
the

care
one
for

whether
one
member
all
the
members
suffer
with

one
member

all
the

rejoice
with

ye
are
the

god
hath
set
some

thirdly
after

all
all
all

all
the

covet
earnestly
the

unto
you
a

when

the
greatest
of
these
chapter
follow
after

desire
spiritual

rather
that
ye
may

he
that
speaketh

speaketh
not
unto

unto

no
man
understandeth
howbeit
in

he
speaketh

he
that
prophesieth
speaketh
unto
men

and
he
that
speaketh
in

tongue
edifieth

he
that
prophesieth
edifieth
the
i
would
that
ye
all
spake
with

rather
that
ye
for
greater
he
that
prophesieth

he
that
speaketh
with

he
that
the
church
may
receive
if
i
come
unto
you
speaking
with
what
shall
i
profit

you
either
by

say
amen
at
thy

the
other
is
not

thank
my
i
speak
with

more
than
ye
yet
in
the
church
i
had
rather
speak
five
words
with

my
i
might
teach
others
than
ten
thousand
words
in

in
the

with
other
tongues
and
other
lips
will
i
speak
unto
this
and
yet
for
all
that

the
wherefore

to
them
that
believe

that

for
them
which
if
therefore
the
whole
church
be
come
together
into
one
and
all
speak
with
and
there
come
in

they
not

there
come
in
one
that
believeth

he
is
convinced
of
he
is
judged
of
and
thus
are
the
secrets
of
his
heart
made
and
so
falling
down
on

he
will
worship
and
report
that

if
there
be
no
let
him
keep

let
him

of
as
in
all
churches
of
the
let
your
women
keep
silence
in

for
it
is
not
permitted
unto
them
to
but
are
to
be
under
as
also
saith
the
and
if
they
will
learn
any
let
them
ask
their
husbands
at
for
it
is
a
shame
for
women
to
speak
in
the
came
the
word
of
god
out
from
or
came
it
unto
you
if
any
man
think
himself
to
be
a
or
let
him
acknowledge
that
the
things
that
i
write
unto
you
are
the
commandments
of
the
but
if
any
man
be
let
him
be
covet
to
and
forbid
not
to
speak
with
let
all
things
be
done
decently
and
in
chapter
i
declare
unto
you
the
gospel
which
i
preached
unto
which
also
ye
have
and
wherein
ye
by
which
also
ye
are
if
ye
keep
in
memory
what
i
preached
unto
unless
ye
have
believed
in
for
i
delivered
unto
you
first
of
all
that
which
i
also
how
that
christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
and
that
he
was
and
that
he
rose
again
the
third
day
according
to
the
and
that
he
was
seen
of
then
of
the
after
he
was
seen
of
above
five
hundred
brethren
at
of
whom
the
greater
part
remain
unto
this
but
some
are
fallen
after
he
was
seen
of
then
of
all
the
and
last
of
all
he
was
seen
of
me
as
of
one
born
out
of
due
for
i
am
the
least
of
the
that
am
not
meet
to
be
called
an
because
i
persecuted
the
church
of
but
by
the
grace
of
god
i
am
what
i
and
his
grace
which
upon
me
was
not
in
but
i
laboured
more
abundantly
than
they
yet
not
but
the
grace
of
god
which
was
with
therefore
whether
i
or
so
we
and
so
ye
now
if
christ
be
preached
that
he
rose
from
the
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
but
if
there
be
no
resurrection
of
the
then
is
christ
not
and
if
christ
be
not
then
our
preaching
and
your
faith
also
and
we
are
found
false
witnesses
of
because
we
have
testified
of
god
that
he
raised
up
whom
he
raised
not
if
so
be
that
the
dead
rise
for
if
the
dead
rise
then
is
not
christ
and
if
christ
be
not
your
faith
ye
are
yet
in
your
then
they
also
which
are
fallen
asleep
in
christ
are
if
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
we
are
of
all
men
most
but
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
become
the
firstfruits
of
them
that
for
since
by
man
by
man
also
the
resurrection
of
the
for
as
in
adam
all
even
so
in
christ
shall
all
be
made
but
every
man
in
his
own
christ
the
afterward
they
that
are
at
his
then
the
when
he
shall
have
delivered
up
the
kingdom
to
even
the
when
he
shall
have
put
down
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
for
he
must
till
he
hath
put
all
enemies
under
his
the
last
enemy
shall
be
destroyed
for
he
hath
put
all
things
under
his
but
when
he
saith
all
things
are
put
under
it
manifest
that
he
is
which
did
put
all
things
under
and
when
all
things
shall
be
subdued
unto
then
shall
the
son
also
himself
be
subject
unto
him
that
put
all
things
under
that
god
may
be
all
in
else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
why
are
they
then
baptized
for
the
and
why
stand
we
in
jeopardy
every
i
protest
by
your
rejoicing
which
i
have
in
christ
jesus
our
i
die
if
after
the
manner
of
men
i
have
fought
with
beasts
at
what
advantageth
it
if
the
dead
rise
let
us
eat
and
for
to
morrow
we
be
not
evil
communications
corrupt
good
awake
to
and
sin
for
some
have
not
the
knowledge
of
i
speak
to
your
but
some
will
how
are
the
dead
raised
and
with
what
body
do
they
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
except
it
and
that
which
thou
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
but
bare
it
may
chance
of
or
of
some
other
but
god
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
and
to
every
seed
his
own
all
flesh
not
the
same
but
one
flesh
of
another
flesh
of
another
of
another
of
also
celestial
and
bodies
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
and
the
of
the
terrestrial
one
glory
of
the
and
another
glory
of
the
and
another
glory
of
the
for
star
differeth
from

in
so
also
the
resurrection
of

so
it
is
the
first

adam
was
made
a
living

last
adam
a
quickening
howbeit
that
not
first
which
is

that

afterward
that
which
is
the
first
man
of
the
the
second

lord
from
as
the
such

as
the
such

as
we
have
borne
the
image
of

shall
also
bear
the
image
of

that
flesh
and

enduring
of

would
have
you
ignorant
of
our
trouble
which
came
to
us
in
that
we
were
pressed
out
of
above
insomuch
that
we
despaired
even
of
but
we
had
the
sentence
of
death
in
that
we
should
not
trust
in
but
in
god
which
raiseth
the
who
delivered
us
from
so
great
a
and
doth
in
whom
we
trust
that
he
will
yet
deliver
ye
also
helping
together
by
prayer
for
that
for
the
gift
upon
us
by
the
means
of
many
persons
thanks
may
be
given
by
many
on
our
for
our
rejoicing
is
the
testimony
of
our
that
in
simplicity
and
godly
not
with
fleshly
but
by
the
grace
of
we
have
had
our
conversation
in
the
and
more
abundantly
to
for
we
write
none
other
things
unto
than
what
ye
read
or
and
i
trust
ye
shall
acknowledge
even
to
the
as
also
ye
have
acknowledged
us
in
that
we
are
your
even
as
ye
also
in
the
day
of
the
lord
and
in
this
confidence
i
was
minded
to
come
unto
you
that
ye
might
have
a
second
and
to
pass
by
you
into
and
to
come
again
out
of
macedonia
unto
and
of
you
to
be
brought
on
my
way
toward
when
i
therefore
was
thus
did
i
use
or
the
things
that
i
do
i
purpose
according
to
the
that
with
me
there
should
be
yea
and
nay
but
god
our
word
toward
you
was
not
yea
and
for
the
son
of
jesus
who
was
preached
among
you
by
by
me
and
silvanus
and
was
not
yea
and
but
in
him
was
for
all
the
promises
of
god
in
him
and
in
him
unto
the
glory
of
god
by
now
he
which
stablisheth
us
with
you
in
and
hath
anointed
who
hath
also
sealed
and
given
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
in
our
moreover
i
call
god
for
a
record
upon
my
that
to
spare
you
i
came
not
as
yet
unto
not
for
that
we
have
dominion
over
your
but
are
helpers
of
your
for
by
faith
ye
chapter
but
i
determined
this
with
that
i
would
not
come
again
to
you
in
for
if
i
make
you
who
is
he
then
that
maketh
me
but
the
same
which
is
made
sorry
by
and
i
wrote
this
same
unto
when
i
i
should
have
sorrow
from
them
of
whom
i
ought
to
having
confidence
in
you
that
my
joy
is
of
you
for
out
of
much
affliction
and
anguish
of
heart
i
wrote
unto
you
with
many
not
that
ye
should
be
but
that
ye
might
know
the
love
which
i
have
more
abundantly
unto
but
if
any
have
caused
he
hath
not
grieved
but
in
that
i
may
not
overcharge
you
sufficient
to
such
a
man
this
which
of
so
that
contrariwise
ye
rather
to
forgive
and
comfort
lest
perhaps
such
a
one
should
be
swallowed
up
with
overmuch
wherefore
i
beseech
you
that
ye
would
confirm
love
toward
for
to
this
end
also
did
i
that
i
might
know
the
proof
of
whether
ye
be
obedient
in
all
to
whom
ye
forgive
any
i
for
if
i
forgave
any
to
whom
i
forgave
for
your
sakes
i
in
the
person
of
lest
satan
should
get
an
advantage
of
for
we
are
not
ignorant
of
his
when
i
came
to
troas
to
and
a
door
was
opened
unto
me
of
the
i
had
no
rest
in
my
because
i
found
not
titus
my
but
taking
my
leave
of
i
went
from
thence
into
now
thanks
unto
which
always
causeth
us
to
triumph
in
and
maketh
manifest
the
savour
of
his
knowledge
by
us
in
every
for
we
are
unto
god
a
sweet
savour
of
in
them
that
are
and
in
them
that
to
the
one
the
savour
of
death
unto
and
to
the
other
the
savour
of
life
unto
and
who
sufficient
for
these
for
we
are
not
as
which
corrupt
the
word
of
but
as
of
but
as
of
in
the
sight
of
god
speak
we
in
chapter
do
we
begin
again
to
commend
or
need
as
some
epistles
of
commendation
to
or
of
commendation
from
ye
are
our
epistle
written
in
our
known
and
read
of
all
as
ye
manifestly
declared
to
be
the
epistle
of
christ
ministered
by
written
not
with
but
with
the
spirit
of
the
living
not
in
tables
of
but
in
fleshy
tables
of
the
and
such
trust
have
we
through
christ
to
not
that
we
are
sufficient
of
ourselves
to
think
any
thing
as
of
but
our
sufficiency
of
who
also
hath
made
us
able
ministers
of
the
new
not
of
the
but
of
the
for
the
letter
but
the
spirit
giveth
but
if
the
ministration
of
written
engraven
in
was
so
that
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stedfastly
behold
the
face
of
moses
for
the
glory
of
his
which
was
to
be
done
how
shall
not
the
ministration
of
the
spirit
be
rather
for
if
the
ministration
of
condemnation
much
more
doth
the
ministration
of
righteousness
exceed
in
for
even
that
which
was
made
glorious
had
no
glory
in
this
by
reason
of
the
glory
that
for
if
that
which
is
done
away
much
more
that
which
remaineth
seeing
then
that
we
have
such
we
use
great
plainness
of
and
not
as
put
a
vail
over
his
that
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stedfastly
look
to
the
end
of
that
which
is
but
their
minds
were
for
until
this
day
remaineth
the
same
vail
untaken
away
in
the
reading
of
the
old
which
is
done
away
in
but
even
unto
this
when
moses
is
the
vail
is
upon
their
nevertheless
when
it
shall
turn
to
the
the
vail
shall
be
taken
now
the
lord
is
that
and
where
the
spirit
of
the
lord
there
but
we
with
open
face
beholding
as
in
a
glass
the
glory
of
the
are
changed
into
the
same
image
from
glory
to
as
by
the
spirit
of
the
chapter
therefore
seeing
we
have
this
as
we
have
received
we
faint
but
have
renounced
the
hidden
things
of
not
walking
in
nor
handling
the
word
of
god
but
by
manifestation
of
the
truth
commending
ourselves
to
every
conscience
in
the
sight
of
but
if
our
gospel
be
it
is
hid
to
them
that
are
in
whom
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
who
is
the
image
of
should
shine
unto
for
we
preach
not
but
christ
jesus
the
and
ourselves
your
servants
for
for
who
commanded
the
light
to
shine
out
of
hath
shined
in
our
to
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
in
the
face
of
jesus
but
we
have
this
treasure
in
earthen
that
the
excellency
of
the
power
may
be
of
and
not
of
troubled
on
every
yet
not
but
not
in
but
not
cast
but
not
always
bearing
about
in
the
body
the
dying
of
the
lord
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
for
we
which
live
are
alway
delivered
unto
death
for
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
mortal
so
then
death
worketh
in
but
life
in
we
having
the
same
spirit
of
according
as
it
is
i
and
therefore
have
i
we
also
and
therefore
knowing
that
he
which
raised
up
the
lord
jesus
shall
raise
up
us
also
by
and
shall
present
with
for
all
things
for
your
that
the
abundant
grace
might
through
the
thanksgiving
of
many
redound
to
the
glory
of
for
which
cause
we
faint
but
though
our
outward
man
yet
the
inward
is
renewed
day
by
for
our
light
which
is
but
for
a
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
eternal
weight
of
while
we
look
not
at
the
things
which
are
but
at
the
things
which
are
not
for
the
things
which
are
seen
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
chapter
for
we
know
that
if
our
earthly
house
of
tabernacle
were
we
have
a
building
of
an
house
not
made
with
eternal
in
the
for
in
this
we
earnestly
desiring
to
be
clothed
upon
with
our
house
which
is
from
if
so
be
that
being
clothed
we
shall
not
be
found
for
we
that
are
in
tabernacle
do
being
not
for
that
we
would
be
but
clothed
that
mortality
might
be
swallowed
up
of
now
he
that
hath
wrought
us
for
the
selfsame
thing
who
also
hath
given
unto
us
the
earnest
of
the
therefore
always
knowing
whilst
we
are
at
home
in
the
we
are
absent
from
the
we
walk
by
not
by
we
are
and
willing
rather
to
be
absent
from
the
and
to
be
present
with
the
wherefore
we
whether
present
or
we
may
be
accepted
of
for
we
must
all
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
that
every
one
may
receive
the
things
in
according
to
that
he
hath

good
or
knowing
therefore
the
terror
of
the
we
persuade
but
we
are
made
manifest
unto
and
i
trust
also
are
made
manifest
in
your
for
we
commend
not
ourselves
again
unto
but
give
you
occasion
to
glory
on
our
that
ye
may
have
somewhat
to
them
which
glory
in
and
not
in
for
whether
we
be
beside
to
or
whether
we
be
for
your
for
the
love
of
christ
constraineth
because
we
thus
that
if
one
died
for
then
were
all
and
he
died
for
that
they
which
live
should
not
henceforth
live
unto
but
unto
him
which
died
for
and
rose
wherefore
henceforth
know
we
no
man
after
the
though
we
have
known
christ
after
the
yet
now
henceforth
know
we
no
therefore
if
any
man
in
a
new
old
things
are
passed
all
things
are
become
and
all
things
of
who
hath
reconciled
us
to
himself
by
jesus
and
hath
given
to
us
the
ministry
of
to
that
god
was
in
reconciling
the
world
unto
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
and
hath
committed
unto
us
the
word
of
now
then
we
are
ambassadors
for
as
though
god
did
beseech
by
we
pray
in
be
ye
reconciled
to
for
he
hath
made
him
sin
for
who
knew
no
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
chapter
we
workers
together
beseech
also
that
ye
receive
not
the
grace
of
god
in
he
i
have
heard
thee
in
a
time
and
in
the
day
of
salvation
have
i
succoured
now
the
accepted

of
giving
no
offence
in
any
that

by
the
consolation
wherewith
he
was
comforted
in
when
he
told
us
your
earnest
your
your
fervent
mind
toward
so
that
i
rejoiced

for
though
i
made
you
sorry
with
a

not
though
i
did

i
perceive
that
the
same
epistle
hath
made
you
though
but
for
a
now
i
not
that
ye
were
made
but
that
ye
sorrowed
to
for
ye
were
made
sorry
after
a
godly
that
ye
might
receive
damage
by
us
in
for
godly
sorrow

repentance
to
salvation
not
to
be
repented

the
sorrow
of
the
world
worketh
for
behold
this
selfsame
that
ye
sorrowed
after
a
godly
what
carefulness
it
wrought
in
clearing
of
vehement
in
all
ye
have
approved
yourselves
to
be
clear
in
this
though
i
wrote
unto
did
not
for
his
cause
that
had
done
the
nor
for
his
cause
that
suffered
but
that
our
care
for
you
in
the
sight
of
god
might
appear
unto
therefore
we
were
comforted
in
your
and
exceedingly
the
more
joyed
we
for
the
joy
of
because
his
spirit
was
refreshed
by
you
for
if
i
have
boasted
any
thing
to
him
of
i
am
not
but
as
we
spake
all
things
to
you
in
even
so
our
which
before
is
found
a
and
his
inward
affection
is
more
abundant
toward
whilst
he
remembereth
the
obedience
of
you
how
with
fear
and
trembling
ye
received
i
rejoice
therefore
that
i
have
confidence
in
you
in
all
chapter
we
do
you
to
wit
of
the
grace
of
god
bestowed
on
the
churches
of
how
that
in
a
great
trial
of
affliction
the
abundance
of
their
joy
and
their
deep
poverty
abounded
unto
the
riches
of
their
for
to
i
bear
and
beyond
power
willing
of
praying
us
with
much
intreaty
that
we
would
receive
the
and
upon
the
fellowship
of
the
ministering
to
the
and
they
not
as
we
but
first
gave
their
own
selves
to
the
and
unto
us
by
the
will
of
insomuch
that
we
desired
that
as
he
had
so
he
would
also
finish
in
you
the
same
grace
as
ye
abound
in
every
and
and
and
all
and
your
love
to
that
ye
abound
in
this
grace
i
speak
not
by
but
by
occasion
of
the
forwardness
of
and
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
your
for
ye
know
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
though
he
was
yet
for
your
sakes
he
became
that
ye
through
his
poverty
might
be
and
herein
i
give
for
this
is
expedient
for
who
have
begun
not
only
to
but
also
to
be
forward
a
year
now
therefore
perform
the
doing
that
as
a
readiness
to
so
may
a
performance
also
out
of
that
which
ye
for
if
there
be
first
a
willing
accepted
according
to
that
a
man
not
according
to
that
he
hath
for
not
that
other
men
be
and
ye
but
by
an
now
at
this
time
your
abundance
be
a
for
their
that
their
abundance
also
may
be
for
your
that
there
may
be
as
it
is
he
that
much
had
nothing
and
he
that
little
had
no
but
thanks
to
which
put
the
same
earnest
care
into
the
heart
of
titus
for
for
indeed
he
accepted
the
but
being
more
of
his
own
accord
he
went
unto
and
we
have
sent
with
him
the
whose
praise
in
the
gospel
throughout
all
the
and
not
but
who
was
also
chosen
of
the
churches
to
travel
with
us
with
this
which
is
administered
by
us
to
the
glory
of
the
same
and
your
ready
avoiding
that
no
man
should
blame
us
in
this
abundance
which
is
administered
by
providing
for
honest
not
only
in
the
sight
of
the
but
also
in
the
sight
of
and
we
have
sent
with
them
our
whom
we
have
oftentimes
proved
diligent
in
many
but
now
much
more
upon
the
great
confidence
which
in
whether
do
of
my
partner
and
fellowhelper
concerning
or
our
brethren
enquired
they
the
messengers
of
the
the
glory
of
wherefore
shew
ye
to
and
before
the
the
proof
of
your
and
of
our
boasting
on
your
chapter
for
as
touching
the
ministering
to
the
it
is
superfluous
for
me
to
write
to
for
i
know
the
forwardness
of
your
for
which
i
boast
of
you
to
them
of
that
achaia
was
ready
a
year
and
your
zeal
hath
provoked
very
yet
have
i
sent
the
lest
our
boasting
of
you
should
be
in
vain
in
this
as
i
ye
may
be
lest
haply
if
they
of
macedonia
come
with
and
find
you
we
we
say
should
be
ashamed
in
this
same
confident
therefore
i
thought
it
necessary
to
exhort
the
that
they
would
go
before
unto
and
make
up
beforehand
your
whereof
ye
had
notice
that
the
same
might
be
as
matter
and
not
as
but
this
he
which
soweth
sparingly
shall
reap
also
and
he
which
soweth
bountifully
shall
reap
also
every
man
according
as
he
purposeth
in
his
let
him
not
or
of
for
god
loveth
a
cheerful
and
god
able
to
make
all
grace
abound
toward
that
always
having
all
sufficiency
in
all
may
abound
to
every
good
it
is
he
hath
dispersed
he
hath
given
to
the
his
righteousness
remaineth
for
now
he
that
ministereth
seed
to
the
sower
both
minister
bread
for
and
multiply
your
seed
and
increase
the
fruits
of
your
being
enriched
in
every
thing
to
all
which
causeth
through
us
thanksgiving
to
for
the
administration
of
this
service
not
only
supplieth
the
want
of
the
but
is
abundant
also
by
many
thanksgivings
unto
whiles
by
the
experiment
of
this
ministration
they
glorify
god
for
your
professed
subjection
unto
the
gospel
of
and
for
liberal
distribution
unto
and
unto
all
and
by
their
prayer
for
which
long
after
you
for
the
exceeding
grace
of
god
in
thanks
unto
god
for
his
unspeakable
chapter
now
i
paul
myself
beseech
you
by
the
meekness
and
gentleness
of
who
in
presence
base
among
but
being
absent
am
bold
toward
but
i
beseech
that
i
may
not
be
bold
when
i
am
present
with
that
wherewith
i
think
to
be
bold
against
which
think
of
us
as
if
we
walked
according
to
the
for
though
we
walk
in
the
we
do
not
war
after
the
the
weapons
of
our
warfare
not
but
mighty
through
god
to
the
pulling
down
of
strong
casting
down
and
every
high
thing
that
exalteth
itself
against
the
knowledge
of
and
bringing
into
captivity
every
thought
to
the
obedience
of
and
having
in
a
readiness
to
revenge
all
when
your
obedience
is
do
ye
look
on
things
after
the
outward
if
any
man
trust
to
himself
that
he
is
let
him
of
himself
think
this
as
he
even
so
we
for
though
i
should
boast
somewhat
more
of
our
which
the
lord
hath
given
us
for
and
not
for
your
i
should
not
be
that
i
may
not
seem
as
if
i
would
terrify
you
by
for
say
weighty
and
but
bodily
presence
and
speech
let
such
an
one
think
such
as
we
are
in
word
by
letters
when
we
are
such
we
also
in
deed
when
we
are
for
we
dare
not
make
ourselves
of
the
or
compare
ourselves
with
some
that
commend
but
they
measuring

we
will
not
boast
of
things
without
but
according
to
the
measure
of
the
rule
which
god
hath
distributed
to
a
measure
to
reach
even
unto

we
stretch
not
ourselves
beyond
as
though
we
reached
not
unto
for
we
are
come
as
far
as
to
you
also
in
the
gospel
of
not
boasting
of
things
without
of
other
but
having
when
your
faith
is
that
we
shall
be
enlarged
by
you
according
to
our
rule
to
preach
the
gospel
in
the
beyond
not
to
boast
in
another
line
of
things
made
ready
to

he
that
let
him
glory
in
the

not
he
that
commendeth
himself
is
but
whom
the
lord
chapter
would
to
god
ye
could
bear
with
me
a
little
in
and
indeed
bear
with
for
i
am
jealous
over
you
with
godly
for
i
have
espoused
you
to
one
that
i
may
present
a
chaste
virgin
to
but
i
lest
by
any
as
the
serpent
beguiled
eve
through
his
so
your
minds
should
be
corrupted
from
the
simplicity
that
is
in
for
if
he
that
cometh
preacheth
another
whom
we
have
not
or
ye
receive
another
which
ye
have
not
or
another
which
ye
have
not
ye
might
well
bear
with
for
i
suppose
i
was
not
a
whit
behind
the
very
chiefest
but
though
rude
in
yet
not
in
but
we
have
been
throughly
made
manifest
among
you
in
all
have
i
committed
an
offence
in
abasing
myself
that
ye
might
be
because
i
have
preached
to
you
the
gospel
of
god
i
robbed
other
taking
wages
to
do
you
and
when
i
was
present
with
and
i
was
chargeable
to
no
for
that
which
was
lacking
to
me
the
brethren
which
came
from
macedonia
and
in
all
i
have
kept
myself
from
being
burdensome
unto
and
will
i
keep
as
the
truth
of
christ
is
in
no
man
shall
stop
me
of
this
boasting
in
the
regions
of
because
i
love
you
god
but
what
i
that
i
will
that
i
may
cut
off
occasion
from
them
which
desire
that
wherein
they
they
may
be
found
even
as
for
such
false
deceitful
transforming
themselves
into
the
apostles
of
and
no
for
satan
himself
is
transformed
into
an
angel
of
therefore
no
great
thing
if
his
ministers
also
be
transformed
as
the
ministers
of
whose
end
shall
be
according
to
their

say
let
no
man
think
me
a

i
may
boast
myself

i
i

in

was
i
let
down
by

escaped
his
chapter
it
is
not
expedient
for
me
doubtless
to
i
will
come
to
visions
and
revelations
of
the
i
knew
a
man
in
christ
above
fourteen
years
in
the
i
cannot
or
whether
out
of

such
an

caught
up

i
knew
such

out
of

how
that
he
was
caught
up
into
and
heard
unspeakable
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
a

to
of
such
an

will
i
yet
of
myself
i
will
not
but
in
mine
for
though
i
would
desire
to
i
shall
not
be

i
will
say
the
but
i
lest
any
man
should
think
of
me
above
that
which
he
seeth
me
or
he
heareth
of
and
lest
i
should
be
exalted
above
measure
through
the
abundance
of
the
there
was
given
to
me
a
thorn
in
the
the
messenger
of
satan
to
buffet
lest
i
should
be
exalted
above
for
this
thing
i
besought
the
lord
that
it
might
depart
from
and
he
said
unto
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
for
my
strength
is
made
perfect
in
most
gladly
therefore
will
i
rather
glory
in
my
that
the
power
of
christ
may
rest
upon
therefore
i
take
pleasure
in
in
in
in
in
distresses
for
for
when
i
am
then
am
i
i
am
become
a
fool
in
ye
have
compelled
for
i
ought
to
have
been
commended
of
for
in
nothing
am
i
behind
the
very
chiefest
though
i
be
truly
the
signs
of
an
apostle
were
wrought
among
you
in
all
in
and
and
mighty
for
what
is
it
wherein
ye
were
inferior
to
other
except
that
i
myself
was
not
burdensome
to
forgive
me
this
the
third
time
i
am
ready
to
come
to
and
i
will
not
be
burdensome
to
for
i
seek
not
but
for
the
children
ought
not
to
lay
up
for
the
but
the
parents
for
the
and
i
will
very
gladly
spend
and
be
spent
for
though
the
more
abundantly
i
love
the
less
i
be
but
be
it
i
did
not
burden
being
i
caught
you
with
did
i
make
a
gain
of
you
by
any
of
them
whom
i
sent
unto
i
desired
and
with
i
sent
a
did
titus
make
a
gain
of
walked
we
not
in
the
same
not
in
the
same
think
ye
that
we
excuse
ourselves
unto
we
speak
before
god
in
but
all
dearly
for
your
for
i
when
i
i
shall
not
find
you
such
as
i
and
i
shall
be
found
unto
you
such
as
ye
would
lest
when
i
come
my
god
will
humble
me
among
and
i
shall
bewail
many
which
have
sinned
and
have
not
repented
of
the
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
lasciviousness
which
they
have
chapter
this
the
third
i
am
coming
to
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
shall
every
word
be
i
told
you
and
foretell
as
if
i
were
the
second
and
being
absent
now
i
write
to
them
which
heretofore
have
and
to
all
if
i
come
i
will
not
since
ye
seek
a
proof
of
christ
speaking
in
which
to
is
not
but
is
mighty
in
for
though
he
was
crucified
through
yet
he
liveth
by
the
power
of
for
we
also
are
weak
in
but
we
shall
live
with
him
by
the
power
of
god
toward
examine
whether
ye
be
in
the
prove
your
own
know
ye
not
your
own
how
that
jesus
christ
is
in
except
ye
be
but
i
trust
that
ye
shall
know
that
we
are
not
now
i
pray
to
god
that
ye
do
no
not
that
we
should
appear
but
that
ye
should
do
that
which
is
though
we
be
as
for
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
but
for
the
for
we
are
when
we
are
and
ye
are
and
this
also
we
your
therefore
i
write
these
things
being
lest
being
present
i
should
use
according
to
the
power
which
the
lord
hath
given
me
to
and
not
to
be
be
of
good
be
of
one
live
in
and
the
god
of
love
and
peace
shall
be
with
greet
one
another
with
an
holy
all
the
saints
salute
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
and
the
love
of
and
the
communion
of
the
holy
with
you
the
second
to
the
corinthians
was
written
from
of
by
titus
and
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
galatians
chapter
an
of
neither
by
but
by
jesus
and
god
the
who
raised
him
from
the
and
all
the
brethren
which
are
with
unto
the
churches
of
grace
to
you
and
peace
from
god
the
and
our
lord
jesus
who
gave
himself
for
our
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
our
to
whom
glory
for
ever
and
i
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
from
him
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
christ
unto
another
which
is
not
but
there
be
some
that
trouble
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
but
though
or
an
angel
from
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
let
him
be
as
we
said
so
say
i
now
if
any
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
let
him
be
for
do
i
now
persuade
or
or
do
i
seek
to
please
for
if
i
yet
pleased
i
should
not
be
the
servant
of
but
i
certify
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
for
i
neither
received
it
of
neither
was
i
taught
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
for
ye
have
heard
of
my
conversation
in
time
past
in
the
how
that
beyond
measure
i
persecuted
the
church
of
and
wasted
and
profited
in
the
religion
above
many
my
equals
in
mine
own
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
of
the
traditions
of
my
but
when
it
pleased
who
separated
me
from
my
and
called
by
his
to
reveal
his
son
in
that
i
might
preach
him
among
the
immediately
i
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
neither
went
i
up
to
jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
but
i
went
into
and
returned
again
unto
then
after
three
years
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
to
see
and
abode
with
him
fifteen
but
other
of
the
apostles
saw
i
save
james
the
now
the
things
which
i
write
unto
before
i
lie
afterwards
i
came
into
the
regions
of
syria
and
and
was
unknown
by
face
unto
the
churches
of
judaea
which
were
in
but
they
had
heard
that
he
which
persecuted
us
in
times
past
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
he
and
they
glorified
god
in
chapter
then
fourteen
years
after
i
went
up
again
to
jerusalem
with
and
took
titus
with
and
i
went
up
by
and
communicated
unto
them
that
gospel
which
i
preach
among
the
but
privately
to
them
which
were
of
lest
by
any
means
i
should
or
had
in
but
neither
who
was
with
being
a
was
compelled
to
be
and
that
because
of
false
brethren
unawares
brought
who
came
in
privily
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
that
they
might
bring
us
into
to
whom
we
gave
place
by
not
for
an
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
but
of
these
who
seemed
to
be
they
it
maketh
no
matter
to
god
accepteth
no
for
they
who
seemed
be
in
conference
added
nothing
to
but
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
as
of
the
circumcision
unto
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
peter
to
the
apostleship
of
the
the
same
was
mighty
in
me
toward
the
and
when
and
who
seemed
to
be
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
they
gave
to
me
and
barnabas
the
right
hands
of
that
we
unto
the
and
they
unto
the
only
that
we
should
remember
the
the
same
which
i
also
was
forward
to
but
when
peter
was
come
to
i
withstood
him
to
the
because
he
was
to
be
for
before
that
certain
came
from
he
did
eat
with
the
but
when
they
were
he
withdrew
and
separated
fearing
them
which
were
of
the
and
the
other
jews
dissembled
likewise
with
insomuch
that
barnabas
also
was
carried
away
with
their
but
when
i
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
to
the
truth
of
the
i
said
unto
peter
before
if
being
a
livest
after
the
manner
of
and
not
as
do
the
why
compellest
thou
the
gentiles
to
live
as
do
the
we
jews
by
and
not
sinners
of
the
knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
but
by
the
faith
of
jesus
even
we
have
believed
in
jesus
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
but
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
we
ourselves
also
are
found
therefore
christ
the
minister
of
god
for
if
i
build
again
the
things
which
i
i
make
myself
a
for
i
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
that
i
might
live
unto
i
am
crucified
with
nevertheless
i
yet
not
but
christ
liveth
in
and
the
life
which
i
now
live
in
the
flesh
i
live
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
who
loved
and
gave
himself
for
i
do
not
frustrate
the
grace
of
for
if
righteousness
by
the
then
christ
is
dead
in
chapter
o
foolish
who
hath
bewitched
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
before
whose
eyes
jesus
christ
hath
been
evidently
set
crucified
among
this
only
would
i
learn
of
received
ye
the
spirit
by
the
works
of
the
or
by
the
hearing
of
are
ye
so
having
begun
in
the
are
ye
now
made
perfect
by
the
have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
if
yet
in
he
therefore
that
ministereth
to
you
the
and
worketh
miracles
among
he
by
the
works
of
the
or
by
the
hearing
of
even
as
abraham
believed
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
the
same
are
the
children
of
and
the
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
so
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
for
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under

for
it
is
cursed
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
but
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
the
just
shall
live
by
and
the
law
is
not
of
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
christ

redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
being
made
a
curse
for
for
it
is
cursed
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
that
the
blessing
of
abraham
might
come
on
the
gentiles
through
jesus
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
spirit
through
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
though
but
a
yet
it
no
man
or
addeth
now
to
abraham
and
his
seed
were
the
promises
he
saith
and
to
as
of
but
as
of
and
to
thy
which
is
and
this
i
the
that
was
confirmed
before
of
god
in
the
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
cannot
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
none
for
if
the
inheritance
of
the
no
more
of
but
god
gave
to
abraham
by
wherefore
then
the
it
was
added
because
of
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
it
ordained
by
angels
in
the
hand
of
a
now
a
mediator
is
not
of
but
god
is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
god
for
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
verily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
but
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
that
the

ye
are
all
the
children
of

faith
in

of

nothing
from

though
he
be
lord
of

is
under
tutors
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
even
so
when
we
were
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
but
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
god
sent
forth
his
made

redeem
them
that

because
ye
are

sent
forth
the
spirit
of
his

into
your
wherefore
thou
art
no
more

if
a
then
an
heir
of
god
through
howbeit
when
ye
knew
not
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
are
no
but
after
that
ye
have
known
or
rather
are
known
of
how
turn
ye
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
whereunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
ye
observe
and
and
and
i
am
afraid
of
lest
i
have
bestowed
upon
you
labour
in
i
beseech
be
as
i
for
i
as
ye
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
ye
know
how
through
infirmity
of
the
flesh
i
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
at
the
and
my
temptation
which
was
in
my
flesh
ye
despised
nor
but
received
me
as
an
angel
of
as
christ
where
is
then
the
blessedness
ye
spake
for
i
bear
you
if
had
ye
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
and
have
given
them
to
am
i
therefore
become
your
because
i
tell
you
the
they
zealously
affect
not
they
would
exclude
that
ye
might
affect
but
good
to
be
zealously
affected
always
in
good
and
not
only
when
i
am
present
with
my
little
of
whom
i
travail
in
birth
again
until
christ
be
formed
in
i
desire
to
be
present
with
you
and
to
change
my
for
i
stand
in
doubt
of
tell
ye
that
desire
to
be
under
the
do
ye
not
hear
the
for
it
is
that
abraham
had
two
the
one
by
a
the
other
by
a
but
he
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
after
the
but
he
of
the
freewoman
by
which
things
are
an
for
these
are
the
two
the
one
from
the
mount
which
gendereth
to
which
is
for
this
agar
is
mount
sinai
in
and
answereth
to
jerusalem
which
now
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
but
jerusalem
which
is
above
is
which
is
the
mother
of
us
for
it
is
barren
that
bearest
break
forth
and
thou
that
travailest
for
the
desolate
hath
many
more
children
than
she
which
hath
an
now
as
isaac
are
the
children
of
but
as
then
he
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
was
after
the
even
so
nevertheless
what
saith
the
cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
the
son
of
the
so
we
are
not
children
of
the
but
of
the
chapter
stand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
us
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
i
paul
say
unto
that
if
ye
be
christ
shall
profit
you
for
i
testify
again
to
every
man
that
is
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
do
the
whole
christ
is
become
of
no
effect
unto
whosoever
of
you
are
justified
by
the
ye
are
fallen
from
for
we
through
the
spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
for
in
jesus
christ
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
nor
but
faith
which
worketh
by
ye
did
run
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
this
persuasion
not
of
him
that
calleth
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
i
have
confidence
in
you
through
the
that
ye
will
be
none
otherwise
but
he
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
whosoever
he
and
if
i
yet
preach
why
do
i
yet
suffer
then
is
the
offence
of
the
cross
i
would
they
were
even
cut
off
which
trouble
ye
have
been
called
unto
only
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to

but
by
love
serve
one
for
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
in
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
but
if
ye
bite

devour
one
take
heed
that
ye
be

one
of

spirit
against

these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
so
that
ye
cannot
do
the
things
that
ye
but
if
ye
be
led
of
the
ye
are
not
under

now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
which
are
and
such
of
the
which
i
tell
you
as
i
have
also
told
in
time
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
but
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
against
such
there
is
no
and
they
that
are
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
affections
and
if
we
live
in
the
let
us
also
walk
in
the
let
us
not
be
desirous
of
vain
provoking
one
envying
one
chapter
if
a
man
be
overtaken
in
a
ye
which
are
restore
such
an
one
in
the
spirit
of
considering
lest
thou
also
be

ye
one

so
fulfil
the
law
of
for
if
a
man
think
himself
to
be
when
he
is
he
deceiveth
but
let
every
man
prove
his
own
and
then
shall
he
have
rejoicing
in
himself
and
not
in
for
every
man
shall
bear
his
own
let
him
that
is
taught
in
the
word
communicate
unto
him
that
teacheth
in
all
good

not
god
is
not
for
whatsoever
a
man
that
shall
he
also
for
he
that
soweth
to
his
flesh
shall
of
the
flesh
reap
but
he
that
soweth
to
the
spirit
shall
of
the
spirit
reap
life
and
let
us
not
be
weary
in
well
for
in
due
season
we
shall
if
we
faint
as
we
have
therefore
let
us
do
good
unto
all

called
uncircumcision
by
that
which
is
called
the
circumcision
in
the

made
by

at
that

were
without
being
aliens
from

strangers
from

no

without
god
in

now
in

jesus
ye
who
sometimes
were
far
off
are
made
nigh
by
the
blood
of

he
is
our
who
hath
made
both
and
hath
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
partition
having
abolished
in
his
flesh
the
the
law
of
commandments
in
for
to
make
in
himself
of
twain
one
new
making
and
that
he
might
reconcile
both
unto
god
in
one
body
by
the
having
slain
the
enmity
and
came
and
preached
peace
to
you
which
were
afar
and
to
them
that
were
for
through
him
we
both
have
access
by
one
spirit
unto
the
now

no
more
strangers

all
the
building
fitly
framed
together
groweth
unto
an
holy
temple
in

ye
ye
may
understand
my
knowledge
in
the
mystery

in
other
ages
was
not
made
known
unto

it
is

should
be

partakers
of
his
promise
in

the
whereof
i
was
made
a

given
unto
me
by
the
effectual
working
of
his
unto
who
am
less

this
grace

should
preach
among
the
gentiles
the
unsearchable
riches
of
and
to
make
all
see
what
the
fellowship
of
the
which
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
hath
been
hid
in
who
created
all
things
by

the
intent
that
now
unto

that
ye
henceforth
walk
not
as
other
gentiles
in
the
vanity
of
their
having
the
understanding
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
god
through
the
ignorance
that
is
in
because
of
the
blindness
of
their
who
being
past
feeling
have
given
themselves
over
unto
to
work
all
uncleanness
with
but
ye
have
not
so
learned
if
so
be
that
ye
have
heard
and
have
been
taught
by
as
the
truth
is
in
that
ye
put
off
concerning
the
former
conversation
the
old
which
is
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
and
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
your
and
that
ye
put
on
the
new
which
after
god
is
created
in
righteousness
and

wherefore
putting
away
speak
every

truth
with

him
working
with

the
thing
which
is
that
he
may
have
to
give
to
him
that
let
no
corrupt
communication
proceed
out
of
your

that
which
is
good
to
the
use
of
that
it
may
minister
grace
unto
the

not
the
holy

ye
are

hath
forgiven
chapter
be
ye
therefore
followers
of
as
dear
and
walk
in
as
christ
also
hath
loved
and
hath
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice

for
because
of
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
of

of
the

of
the

in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
proving
what
is
acceptable
unto
the
and
have
no
fellowship
with
the
unfruitful
works
of
but
rather
reprove
for
it
is
a
shame
even
to
speak
of
those
things
which
are
done
of
them
in

all
things
that
are
reproved
are
made

be
ye
not

understanding
what
the

be
filled
with
the
speaking
to
yourselves
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
singing

making
melody
in
your
heart
to
the
giving
thanks
always
for
all
things
unto
god
and
the

submitting
yourselves
one
to
another
in
the
fear
of
submit
yourselves
unto
your

unto

the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the

he
is
the
saviour
of

therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto

the
wives
to
their

also
loved

himself
for

that
he
might
present
it
to
himself
a
glorious
not

any
such

that
it
should
be

i
long
after

this
i
that
your

may
abound
yet
more
and
more
in

all
that
ye
may
approve
things
that
are
that
ye
may

without
offence
till
the
day
of
being
filled
with
the
fruits
of

are
by

i
would
ye
should
that
the
things
unto
me
have
fallen
out
rather
unto
the
furtherance
of
the
so
that
my
bonds
in
christ
are
manifest
in
all
the
and
in
all
other
and
many
of
the
brethren
in
the
waxing
confident
by
my
are
much
more
bold
to
speak
the
word
without
some
indeed
preach
christ
even
of
envy
and
and
some
also
of
good
the
one
preach
christ
of
not
supposing
to
add
affliction
to
my
but
the
other
of
knowing
that
i
am
set
for
the
defence
of
the
what
every
whether
in
or
in
christ
is
and
i
therein
do
and
will
for
i
know
that
this
shall
turn
to
my
salvation
through
your
and
the
supply
of
the
spirit
of
jesus
according
to
my
earnest
expectation
and
that
in
nothing
i
shall
be
but
with
all
as
now
also
christ
shall
be
magnified
in
my
whether
by
or
by
for
to
me
to
live
and
to
die
but
if
i
live
in
the
this
the
fruit
of
my
yet
what
i
shall
choose
i
wot
for
i
am
in
a
strait
betwixt
having
a
desire
to
and
to
be
with
which
is
far
nevertheless
to
abide
in
the
flesh
more
needful
for
and
having
this
i
know
that
i
shall
abide
and
continue
with
you
all
for
your
furtherance
and
joy
of
that
your
rejoicing
may
be
more
abundant
in
jesus
christ
for
me
by
my
coming
to
you
only
let
your
conversation
be
as
it
becometh
the
gospel
of
that
whether
i
come
and
see
or
else
be
i
may
hear
of
your
that
ye
stand
fast
in
one
with
one
mind
striving
together
for
the
faith
of
the
and
in
nothing
terrified
by
your
which
is
to
them
an
evident
token
of
but
to
you
of
and
that
of
for
unto
you
it
is
given
in
the
behalf
of
not
only
to
believe
on
but
also
to
suffer
for
his
having
the
same
conflict
which
ye
saw
in
and
now
hear
in
chapter
if
therefore
any
consolation
in
if
any
comfort
of
if
any
fellowship
of
the
if
any
bowels
and
fulfil
ye
my
that
ye
be
having
the
same
of
one
of
one
nothing
through
strife
or
but
in
lowliness
of
mind
let
each
esteem
other
better
than
look
not
every
man
on
his
own
but
every
man
also
on
the
things
of
let
this
mind
be
in
which
was
also
in
christ
being
in
the
form
of
thought
it
not
robbery
to
be
equal
with
but
made
himself
of
no
and
took
upon
him
the
form
of
a
and
was
made
in
the
likeness
of
and
being
found
in
fashion
as
a
he
humbled
and
became
obedient
unto
even
the
death
of
the
wherefore
god
also
hath
highly
exalted
and
given
him
a
name
which
is
above
every
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
should
of
in
and
in
and
under
the
and
every
tongue
should
confess
that
jesus
christ
to
the
glory
of
god
the
my
as
ye
have
always
not
as
in
my
presence
but
now
much
more
in
my
work
out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
and
for
it
is
god
which
worketh
in
you
both
to
will
and
to
do
of
good
do
all
things
without
murmurings
and
that
ye
may
be
blameless
and
the
sons
of
without
in
the
midst
of
a
crooked
and
perverse
among
whom
ye
shine
as
lights
in
the
holding
forth
the
word
of
that
i
may
rejoice
in
the
day
of
that
i
have
not
run
in
neither
laboured
in
and
if
i
be
offered
upon
the
sacrifice
and
service
of
your
i
and
rejoice
with
you
for
the
same
cause
also
do
ye
and
rejoice
with
but
i
trust
in
the
lord
jesus
to
send
timotheus
shortly
unto
that
i
also
may
be
of
good
when
i
know
your
for
i
have
no
man
who
will
naturally
care
for
your
for
all
seek
their
not
the
things
which
are
jesus
but
ye
know
the
proof
of
as
a
son
with
the
he
hath
served
with
me
in
the
him
therefore
i
hope
to
send
so
soon
as
i
shall
see
how
it
will
go
with
but
i
trust
in
the
lord
that
i
also
myself
shall
come
yet
i
supposed
it
necessary
to
send
to
you
my
and
companion
in
and
but
your
and
he
that
ministered
to
my
for
he
longed
after
you
and
was
full
of
because
that
ye
had
heard
that
he
had
been
for
indeed
he
was
sick
nigh
unto
but
god
had
mercy
on
and
not
on
him
but
on
me
lest
i
should
have
sorrow
upon
i
sent
him
therefore
the
more
when
ye
see
him
ye
may
and
that
i
may
be
the
less
receive
him
therefore
in
the
lord
with
all
and
hold
such
in
because
for
the
work
of
christ
he
was
nigh
unto
not
regarding
his
to
supply
your
lack
of
service
toward
chapter
my
rejoice
in
the
to
write
the
same
things
to
to
me
indeed
not
but
for
you
beware
of
beware
of
evil
beware
of
the
for
we
are
the
which
worship
god
in
the
and
rejoice
in
christ
and
have
no
confidence
in
the
though
i
might
also
have
confidence
in

any
other
man
thinketh
that
he
hath

that
which
is

which
is

your
election

unto
you
in
word

also
in
and
in
the
holy
and
in
much
as
ye
know
what
manner
of
men
we
were
among
you
for
your
and
ye
became
followers
of
and
of
the
having
received
the
word
in
much
with
joy
of
the
holy
so
that
ye
were
ensamples
to
all
that
believe
in
macedonia
and
for
from
you
sounded
out
the
word
of
the
lord
not
only
in
macedonia
and
but
also
in
every
place
your
faith
to
is

we
need
not
to
speak
any
for
they
themselves
shew
of
us
what
manner
of
entering
in
we
had
unto
and
how
ye
turned
to
god
from
idols
to
serve
the
living
and
true
and
to
wait
for
his
son
from
whom
he
raised
from
the
which
delivered
us
from
the
wrath
to
chapter
for
know
our
entrance
in
unto
that
it
was
not
in
but
even
after
that
we
had
suffered
and
were
shamefully
as
ye
at
we
were
bold
in
our
god
to
speak
unto
you
the
gospel
of
god
with
much
for
our
exhortation
not
of
nor
of
nor
in
but
as
we
were
allowed
of
god
to
be
put
in
trust
with
the
even
so
we
not
as
pleasing
but
which
trieth
our
for
neither
at
any
time
used
we
flattering
as
ye
nor
a
cloke
of
god
nor
of
men
sought
we
neither
of
nor
of
when
we
might
have
been
as
the
apostles
of
but
we
were
gentle
among
even
as
a
nurse
cherisheth
her
so
being
affectionately
desirous
of
we
were
willing
to
have
imparted
unto
not
the
gospel
of
god
but
also
our
own
because
ye
were
dear
unto
for
ye
our
labour
and
for
labouring
night
and
because
we
would
not
be
chargeable
unto
any
of
we
preached
unto
you
the
gospel
of
ye
and
god
how
holily
and
justly
and
unblameably
we
behaved
ourselves
among
you
that
as
ye
know
how
we
exhorted
and
comforted
and
charged
every
one
of
as
a
father
his
that
ye
would
walk
worthy
of
who
hath
called
you
unto
his
kingdom
and
for
this
cause
also
thank
we
god
without
when
ye
received
the
word
of
god
which
ye
heard
of
ye
received
not
the
word
of
but
as
it
is
in
the
word
of
which
effectually
worketh
also
in
you
that
for
became
followers
of
the
churches
of
god
which
in
judaea
are
in
christ
for
ye
also
have
suffered
like
things
of
your
own
even
as
they
of
the
who
both
killed
the
lord
and
their
own
and
have
persecuted
and
they
please
not
and
are
contrary
to
all
forbidding
us
to
speak
to
the
gentiles
that
they
might
be
to
fill
up
their
sins
for
the
wrath
is
come
upon
them
to
the
but
being
taken
from
you
for
a
short
time
in
not
in
endeavoured
the
more
abundantly
to
see
your
face
with
great
wherefore
we
would
have
come
unto
even
i
once
and
but
satan
hindered
for
what

or
or
crown
of

even
ye
in
the
presence
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
at
his
for
ye
are
our
glory
and
chapter
wherefore
when
we
could
no
longer
we
thought
it
good
to
be
left
at
athens
and
sent
our
and
minister
of
and
our
fellowlabourer
in
the
gospel
of
to
establish
and
to
comfort
you
concerning
your
that
no
man
should
be
moved
by
these
for
yourselves

that
we
are
appointed
for
when
we
were
with
we
told
you
before
that
we
should
suffer
even
as
it
came
to
and
ye
for
this
when
i
could
no
longer
i
sent
to
know
your
lest
by
some
means
the
tempter
have
tempted
and
our
labour
be
in
but
now
when
timotheus
came
from
you
unto
and
brought
us
good
tidings
of
your
faith
and
and
that
ye
have
good
remembrance
of
us
desiring
greatly
to
see
as
we
also
we
were
comforted
over
you
in
all
our
affliction
and
distress
by
your
for
now
we
if
ye
stand
fast
in
the
for
what
thanks
can
we
render
to
god
again
for
for
all
the
joy
wherewith
we
joy
for
your
sakes
before
our
night
and
day
praying
exceedingly
that
we

see
your
and

our
way
unto

you
to

all
his
chapter
furthermore
then
we
beseech
and
exhort
by
the
lord
that
as
ye
have
received
of
us
how
ye
ought
to
walk
and
to
please
ye
would
abound
more
and
for
ye
know
what
commandments
we
gave
you
by
the
lord
for
this
is
the
will
of
your
that
ye
should
abstain
from
that
every
one
of
you
should
know
how
to
possess
his
vessel
in
sanctification
and
not
in
the
lust
of
even
as
the
gentiles
which
know
not
that
no
go
beyond
and
defraud
his
brother
in
because
that
the
lord
the
avenger
of
all
as
we
also
have
forewarned
you
and
for
god
hath
not
called
us
unto
but
unto
he
therefore
that
despiseth
not
but
who
hath
also
given
unto
us
his
holy
but
as
touching
brotherly
love
ye
need
not
that
i
write
unto
for
ye
yourselves
are
taught
of
god
to
love
one
and
indeed
ye
do
it
toward
all
the
brethren
which
are
in
all
but
we
beseech
that
ye
increase
more
and
and
that
ye
study
to
be
and
to
do
your
own
and
to
work
with
your
own
as
we
commanded
that
ye
may
walk
honestly
toward
them
that
are
and
ye
may
have
lack
of
but
i
would
not
have
you
to
be
concerning
them
which
are
that
ye
sorrow
even
as
others
which
have
no
for
if
we
believe
that
jesus
died
and
rose
even
so
them
also
which
sleep
in
jesus
will
god
bring
with
for
this
we
say
unto
you
by
the
word
of
the
that
we
which
are
alive
remain
unto
the
coming
of
the
lord
shall
not
prevent
them
which
are
for
the
lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
a
with
the
voice
of
the
and
with
the
trump
of
and
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
then
we
which
are
alive
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
and
so
shall
we
ever
be
with
the
wherefore
comfort
one
another
with
these
chapter
but
of
the
times
and
the
ye
have
no
need
that
i
write
unto
for
yourselves
know
perfectly
that
the
day
of
the
lord
so
cometh
as
a
thief
in
the
for
when
they
shall
peace
and
then
sudden
destruction
cometh
upon
as
travail
upon
a
woman
with
and
they
shall
not
but
are
not
in
that
that
day
should
overtake
you
as
a
ye
are
all
the
children
of
and
the
children
of
the

let
us
not
as
but
let
us
watch
and
be
for
they
that
sleep
sleep
in
the
and
they
that
be
drunken
are
drunken
in
the
but
let
who
are
of
the
be
putting
on
the
breastplate
of
faith
and
and

that
ye
withdraw
yourselves
from
every
brother
that
walketh
and
not
after
the
tradition
which
he
received
of
for
yourselves
know
how
ye
ought
to
follow
for
we
behaved
not
ourselves
disorderly
among
neither
did
we
eat
any
bread
for
but
wrought
with
labour
and
travail
night
and
that
we
might
not
be
chargeable
to
any
of
not
because
we
have
not
but
to
make
ourselves
an
ensample
unto
you
to
follow
for
even
when
we
were
with
this
we
commanded
that
if
any
would
not
neither
should
he
for
we
hear
that
there
are
some
which
walk
among
you
working
not
at
but
are
now
them
that
are
such
we
command
and
exhort
by
our
lord
jesus
that
with
quietness
they
and
eat
their
own
but
be
not
weary
in
well
and
if
any
man
obey
not
our
word
by
this
note
that
and
have
no
company
with
that
he
may
be
yet
count
not
as
an
but
admonish
as
a
now
the
lord
of
peace
himself
give
you
peace
always
by
all
the
lord
with
you
the
salutation
of
paul
with
mine
own
which
is
the
token
in
every
so
i
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
with
you
the
second
to
the
thessalonians
was
written
from
the
first
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
timothy
chapter
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
by
the
commandment
of
god
our
and
lord
jesus
our
unto
own
son
in
the
from
god
our
father
and
jesus
christ
our
as
i
besought
thee
to
abide
still
at
when
i
went
into
that
thou
mightest
charge
some
that
they
teach
no
other
neither
give
heed
to
fables
and
endless
which
minister
rather
than
godly
edifying
which
is
in
now
the
end
of
the
commandment
is
charity
out
of
a
pure
and
a
good
and
faith
from
which
some
having
swerved
have
turned
aside
unto
vain
desiring
to
be
teachers
of
the
understanding
neither
what
they
nor
whereof
they
but
we
know
that
the
law
if
a
man
use
it
knowing
that
the
law
is
not
made
for
a
righteous
but
for
the
lawless
and
for
the
ungodly
and
for
for
unholy
and
for
murderers
of
fathers
and
murderers
of
for
for
for
them
that
defile
themselves
with
for
for
for
perjured
and
if
there
be
any
other
thing
that
is
contrary
to
sound
according
to
the
glorious
gospel
of
the
blessed
which
was
committed
to
my
and
i
thank
christ
jesus
our
who
hath
enabled
for
that
he
counted
me
putting
me
into
the
who
was
before
a
and
a
and
but
i
obtained
because
i
did
ignorantly
in
and
the
grace
of
our
lord
was
exceeding
abundant
with
faith
and
love
which
is
in
christ
this
a
faithful
and
worthy
of
all
that
christ
jesus
came
into
the
world
to
save
of
whom
i
am
howbeit
for
this
cause
i
obtained
that
in
me
first
jesus
christ
might
shew
forth
all
for
a
pattern
to
them
which
should
hereafter
believe
on
him
to
life
now
unto
the
king
the
only
wise
honour
and
glory
for
ever
and
this
charge
i
commit
unto
son
according
to
the
prophecies
which
went
before
on
that
thou
by
them
mightest
war
a
good
holding
and
a
good
which
some
having
put
away
concerning
faith
have
made
of
whom
is
hymenaeus
and
whom
i
have
delivered
unto
that
they
may
learn
not
to
chapter
i
exhort
first
of
giving
of
be
made
for
all
for
and
all
that
are
in
that
we
may
lead
a
quiet
and
peaceable
life
in
all
godliness
and
for
this
good
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
our
who
will
have
all
men
to
be
and
to
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the

one
mediator
between

and
in

manner
that
women

i
would
have
retained

without
thy

would
i
do
that
thy

should
not
be

for
perhaps
he
therefore
departed
for
a
that
thou
shouldest
receive
him
for
not
now
as
a

above
a
a
brother
specially
to
but
how
much
more
unto
both
in
the
and
in

if
thou
count
me
therefore
a
receive
him
as
if
he
hath
wronged
or
oweth
put
that
on
mine
i
paul
have
written
with
mine
own
i
will
repay

with
your

from

to
by
a
the
epistle
of

the
apostle
to
the
hebrews
chapter
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
whom
he
hath
appointed
heir
of
all
by
whom
also
he
made
the
who
being
the
brightness
of

the
express
image
of
his
and
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
when
he
had
by
himself
purged
our
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
majesty
on
being
made
so
much
better
than
the
as
he
hath
by
inheritance
obtained
a
more
excellent
name
than
for
unto
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
thou
art
my
this
day
have
i
begotten
and
i
will
be
to
him
a
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
and
when
he
bringeth
in
the
firstbegotten
into
the
he
and
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
and
of
the
angels
he
who
maketh
his
angels
and
his
ministers
a
flame
of
but
unto
the
son
thy
o
for
ever
and
a
sceptre
of
righteousness
the
sceptre
of
thy
thou
hast
loved
and
hated
therefore
thy
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
in
the
beginning
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
thine
they
shall
but
thou
and
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
doth
a
and
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
fold
them
and
they
shall
be
but
thou
art
the
and
thy
years
shall
not
but
to
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
sit
on
my
right
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
are
they
not
all
ministering
sent
forth
to
minister
for
them
who
shall
be
heirs
of
chapter
therefore
we
ought
to
give
the
more
earnest
heed
to
the
things
which
we
have
lest
at
any
time
we
should
let
for
if
the
word
spoken
by
angels
was
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a
just
recompence
of
how
shall
we
if
we
neglect
so
great
which
at
the
first
began
to
be
spoken
by
the
and
was
confirmed
unto
us
by
them
that
heard
god
also
bearing
both
with
signs
and
and
with
divers
and
gifts
of
the
holy
according
to
his
own
for
unto
the
angels
hath
he
not
put
in
subjection
the
world
to
whereof
we
but
one
in
a
certain
place
what
is
that
thou
art
mindful
of
or
the
son
of
that
thou
visitest
thou
madest
him
a
little
lower
than
the
thou
crownedst
him
with
glory
and
and
didst
set
him
over
the
works
of
thy
thou
hast
put
all
things
in
subjection
under
his
for
in
that
he
put
all
in
subjection
under
he
left
nothing
not
put
under
but
now
we
see
not
yet
all
things
put
under
but
we
see
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
for
the
suffering
of
crowned
with
glory
and
that
he
by
the
grace
of
god
should
taste
death
for
every
for
it
became
for
whom
all
and
by
whom
all
in
bringing
many
sons
unto
to
make
the
captain
of
their
salvation
perfect
through
for
both
he
that
sanctifieth
and
they
who
are
sanctified
all
of
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
i
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
in
the
midst
of
the
church
will
i
sing
praise
unto
and
i
will
put
my
trust
in
and
behold
i
and
the
children
which
god
hath
given
forasmuch
then
as
the
children
are
partakers
of
flesh
and
he
also
himself
likewise
took
part
of
the
that
through
death
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
that
the
and
deliver
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
for
verily
he
took
not
on
the
nature
but
he
took
on
the
seed
of
wherefore
in
all
things
it
behoved
him
to
be
made
like
unto
that
he
might
be
a
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
in
things
to
to
make
reconciliation
for
the
sins
of
the
for
in
that
he
himself
hath
suffered
being
he
is
able
to
succour
them
that
are
chapter
holy
partakers
of
the
heavenly
consider
the
apostle
and
high
priest
of
our
christ
who
was
faithful
to
him
that
appointed
as
also
moses
in
all
his
for
this
was
counted
worthy
of
more
glory
than
inasmuch
as
he
who
hath
builded
the
house
hath
more
honour
than
the
for
every
house
is
builded
by
some
but
he
that
built
all
things
and
moses
verily
faithful
in
all
his
as
a
for
a
testimony
of
those
things
which
were
to
be
spoken
but
christ
as
a
son
over
his
own
whose
house
are
if
we
hold
fast
the
confidence
and
the
rejoicing
of
the
hope
firm
unto
the
wherefore
the
holy
ghost
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
harden
not
your
as
in
the
in
the
day
of
temptation
in
the
when
your
fathers
tempted
proved
and
saw
my
works
forty
wherefore
i
was
grieved
with
that
and
they
do
alway
err
in
and
they
have
not
known
my
so
i
sware
in
my
they
shall
not
enter
into
my
take
lest
there
be
in
any
of
you
an
evil
heart
of
in
departing
from
the
living
but
exhort
one
another
while
it
is
called
to
lest
any
of
you
be
hardened
through
the
deceitfulness
of
for
we
are
made
partakers
of
if
we
hold
the
beginning
of
our
confidence
stedfast
unto
the
while
it
is
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
harden
not
your
as
in
the
for
when
they
had
did
howbeit
not
all
that
came
out
of
egypt
by
but
with
whom
was
he
grieved
forty
not
with
them
that
had
whose
carcases
fell
in
the
and
to
whom
sware
he
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
but
to
them
that
believed
so
we
see
that
they
could
not
enter
in
because
of
chapter
let
us
therefore
a
promise
being
left
of
entering
into
his
any
of
you
should
seem
to
come
short
of
for
unto
us
was
the
gospel
as
well
as
unto
but
the
word
preached
did
not
profit
not
being
mixed
with
faith
in
them
that
heard
for
we
which
have
believed
do
enter
into
as
he
as
i
have
sworn
in
my
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
although
the
works
were
finished
from
the
foundation
of
the
for
he
spake
in
a
certain
place
of
the
seventh
on
this
and
god
did
rest
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
and
in
this
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
seeing
therefore
it
remaineth
that
some
must
enter
and
they
to
whom
it
was
first
preached
entered
not
in
because
of
he
limiteth
a
certain
saying
in
to
after
so
long
a
as
it
is
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
harden
not
your
for
if
jesus
had
given
them
then
would
he
not
afterward
have
spoken
of
another
there
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
to
the
people
of
for
he
that
is
entered
into
his
he
also
hath
ceased
from
his
own
as
god
from
let
us
labour
therefore
to
enter
into
that
lest
any
man
fall
after
the
same
example
of
for
the
word
of
god
and
and
sharper
than
any
twoedged
piercing
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
soul
and
and
of
the
joints
and
and
a
discerner
of
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
neither
is
there
any
creature
that
is
not
manifest
in
his
but
all
things
naked
and
opened
unto
the
eyes
of
him
with
whom
we
have
to
seeing
then
that
we
have
a
great
high
that
is
passed
into
the
jesus
the
son
of
let
us
hold
fast
for
we
have
not
an
high
priest
which
cannot
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
but
was
in
all
points
tempted
like
as
without
let
us
therefore
come
boldly
unto
the
throne
of
that
we
may
obtain
and
find
grace
to
help
in
time
of
chapter
for
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
to
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
who
can
have
compassion
on
the
and
on
them
that
are
out
of
the
for
that
he
himself
also
is
compassed
with
and
by
reason
hereof
he
as
for
the
so
also
for
to
offer
for
and
no
man
taketh
this
honour
unto
but
he
that
is
called
of
as
so
also
christ
glorified
not
himself
to
be
made
an
high
but
he
that
said
unto
thou
art
my
to
day
have
i
begotten
as
he
saith
also
in
another
thou
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
who
in
the
days
of
his
when
he
had
offered
up
prayers
and
supplications
with
strong
crying
and
tears
unto
him
that
was
able
to
save
him
from
and
was
heard
in
that
he
though
he
were
a
yet
learned
he
obedience
by
the
things
which
he
and
being
made
he
became
the
author
of
eternal
salvation
unto
all
them
that
obey
called
of
god
an
high
priest
after
the
order
of
of
whom
we
have
many
things
to
and
hard
to
be
seeing
ye
are
dull
of
for
when
for
the
time
ye
ought
to
be
ye
have
need
that
one
teach
you
again
which
the
first
principles
of
the
oracles
of
and
are
become
such
as
have
need
of
and
not
of
strong
for
every
one
that
useth
milk
unskilful
in
the
word
of
for
he
is
a
but
strong
meat
belongeth
to
them
that
are
of
full
those
who
by
reason
of
use
have
their
senses
exercised
to
discern
both
good
and
chapter
therefore
leaving
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
let
us
go
on
unto
not
laying
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead
and
of
faith
toward
of
the
doctrine
of
and
of
laying
on
of
and
of
resurrection
of
the
and
of
eternal
and
this
will
we
if
god
for
impossible
for
those
who
were
once
and
have
tasted
of
the
heavenly
and
were
made
partakers
of
the
holy
and
have
tasted
the
good
word
of
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
if
they
shall
fall
to
renew
them
again
unto
seeing
they
crucify
to
themselves
the
son
of
god
and
put
to
an
open
for
the
earth
which

thorns

how
great
this
man
unto
whom
even
the
patriarch
abraham

the
tenth
of

verily
they
that

whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
for
evident
that
our
lord
sprang
out
of
of
which
tribe
moses
spake
nothing
concerning
and
it
is
yet
far
more
for
that
after
the
similitude
of
melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
who
is
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
but
after
the
power
of
an
endless
for
he
thou
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
for
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going
before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
for
the
law
made
nothing
but
the
bringing
in
of
a
better
hope
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
and
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
was
made
those
priests
were
made
without
an
but
this
with
an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
the
lord
sware
and
will
not
thou
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
by
so
much
was
jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
and
they
truly
were
many
because
they
were
not
suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
but
this
because
he
continueth
hath
an
unchangeable
wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
god
by
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
for
such
an
high
priest
became
separate
from
and
made
higher
than
the
who
needeth
not
as
those
high
to
offer
up
first
for
his
own
and
then
for
the
for
this
he
did
when
he
offered
up
for
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
but
the
word
of
the
which
was
since
the
the
who
is
consecrated
for
chapter
now
of
the
things
which
we
have
spoken
the
we
have
such
an
high
who
is
set
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
the
majesty
in
the
a
minister
of
the
and
of
the
true
which
the
lord
and
not
for
every
high
priest
is
ordained
to
offer
gifts
and
wherefore
of
necessity
that
this
man
have
somewhat
also
to
for
if
he
were
on
he
should
not
be
a
seeing
that
there
are
priests
that
offer
gifts
according
to
the
who
serve
unto
the
example
and
shadow
of
heavenly
as
moses
was
admonished
of
god
when
he
was
about
to
make
the
saith
thou
make
all
things
according
to
the
pattern
shewed
to
thee
in
the
but
now
hath
he
obtained
a
more
excellent
by
how
much
also
he
is
the
mediator
of
a
better
which
was
established
upon
better
for
if
that
first
had
been
then
should
no
place
have
been
sought
for
the
for
finding
fault
with
he
the
days
saith
the
when
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
when
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of

they
continued
not
in
my
and
i
regarded
them
saith
the
for
this

make
with
the
house
of

after
those
saith

will
put
my

shall
know
from

will
be
merciful
to
their

hath
made

which
decayeth

ready
to

chapter
then
verily
the
first
had
also
ordinances
of
divine
and
a
worldly
for
there
was
a
tabernacle
the
wherein
the
and
the
and
the
which
is
called
the
and
after
the
second
the
tabernacle
which
is
called
the
holiest
of
which
had
the
golden
and
the
ark
of
the

overlaid
round
about
with
wherein
the
golden
pot
that
had

rod
that
and
the
tables
of

and
over
it
the
cherubims
of
glory
shadowing
the
of
which
we
cannot
now
speak
now
when
these
things
were
thus
the
priests
went
always
into
the
first
accomplishing
the
service
but
into
the
second
the
high
priest
alone
once
every
not
without
which
he
offered
for
and
the
errors
of
the
the
holy
ghost
this
that
the
way
into
the
holiest
of
all
was
not
yet
made
while
as
the
first
tabernacle
was
yet
which
a
figure
for
the
time
then
in
which
were
offered
both
gifts
and
that
could
not
make

that
did
the
service
as
pertaining
to
the

meats
and
and
divers
and
carnal
imposed
until
the
time

christ
being
come
an
high
priest
of
good
things
to
by
a
greater
and
more
perfect
not
made
with
that
is
to
not
of
this
neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
in
once
into
the
holy
having
obtained
eternal
redemption
for
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
and
the
ashes
of
an
heifer
sprinkling
the
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
how
much
more

the
blood
of
who
through
the
eternal
spirit
offered
himself
without
spot
to
purge
your
conscience
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
and
for
this
cause
he
is
the
mediator
of
the
new
that
by
means
of
for
the
redemption
of
the
transgressions
under
the
first
they
which
are
called
might
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
for
where
a
testament
there
must
also
of
necessity
be
the
death
of
the

a
testament
of
force
after
men
are
otherwise
it
is
of
no
strength
at
all
while
the
testator
whereupon
neither
the
first
was
dedicated
without
for
when
moses
had
spoken
every
precept
to
all
the
people
according
to
the
he
took
the
blood
of
calves
and
of
with
and
scarlet
and
and
sprinkled
both
the
and
all
the
this
the
blood
of
the
testament
which
god
hath
enjoined
unto
moreover
he
sprinkled
with
blood
both
the
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
and
almost
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
therefore
necessary
that
the
patterns
of
things
in
the
heavens
should
be
purified
with
but
the
heavenly
things
themselves
with
better
sacrifices
than
for

not
entered
into
the
holy
places
made
with
the
figures
of
the

into
heaven
now
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
god
for

yet
that
he
should
offer
himself
as
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holy
place
every
year
with
blood
of
for
then
must
he
often
have
suffered
since
the
foundation
of
the
but
now
once
in
the
end
of
the
world
hath
he
appeared
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of

as
it
is
appointed
unto
men
once
to

after
this
the
so
christ
was
once
offered
to
bear
the
sins
of
and
unto
them
that
look
for
him
shall
he
appear
the
second
time
without
sin
unto
chapter
for
the
law
having
a
shadow
of
good
things
to
not
the
very
image
of

never
with
those
sacrifices
which
they
offered
year
by
year
continually
make
the
comers
thereunto
for
then
would
they
not
have
ceased
to
be
because
that
the
worshippers
once
purged
should
have
had
no
more
conscience
of

in
those
there
a
remembrance
again
of
sins
every
for
not
possible
that
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
should
take
away
wherefore
when
he
cometh
into
the
he
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldest
but
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
in
burnt
offerings
and
for
sin
thou
hast

the
offering
of
the
body
of
jesus
christ

every
priest
standeth
daily
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the

which
can
never

this
after
he

offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins

down
on

us
draw

a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
and
our
bodies
washed
with

let
us
hold
fast
the
profession
of
faith
without

that

let
us
consider
one
another
to
provoke
unto
love
and
to
good
not
forsaking
the
assembling
of
ourselves
as
the
manner
of
some
but
exhorting
and
so
much
the
as
ye
see
the
day
for
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
for
but
a
certain
fearful
looking
for
of
judgment
and
fiery
which
shall
devour
the
he
that
despised
law
died
without
mercy
under
two
or
three
of
how
much
sorer
suppose
shall
he
be
thought
who
hath
trodden
under
foot
the
son
of
and
hath
counted
the
blood
of
the
wherewith
he
was
an
unholy
and
hath
done
despite
unto
the
spirit
of
for
we
know
him
that
hath
vengeance
unto
i
will
saith
the
and
the
lord
shall
judge
his
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
but
call
to
remembrance
the
former
in
after
ye
were
ye
endured
a
great
fight
of
whilst
ye
were
made
a
gazingstock
both
by
reproaches
and
and
whilst
ye
became
companions
of
them
that
were
so
for
ye
had
compassion
of
me
in
my
and
took
joyfully
the
spoiling
of
your
knowing
in
yourselves
that
ye
have
in
heaven
a
better
and
an
enduring
cast
not
away
therefore
your
which
hath
great
recompence
of
for
ye
have
need
of
after
ye
have
done
the
will
of
ye
might
receive
the
for
yet
a
little
and
he
that
shall
come
will
and
will
not
now
the
just
shall
live
by
but
if
draw
my
soul
shall
have
no
pleasure
in
but
we
are
not
of
them
who
draw
back
unto
but
of
them
that
believe
to
the
saving
of
the
chapter
now
faith
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
the
evidence
of
things
not
for
by
it
the
elders
obtained
a
good
through
faith
we
understand
that
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
so
that
things
which
are
seen
were
not
made
of
things
which
do
by
faith
abel
offered
unto
god
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
than
by
which
he
obtained
witness
that
he
was
god
testifying
of
his
and
by
it
he
being
dead
yet
by
faith
enoch
was
translated
that
he
should
not
see
and
was
not
because
god
had
translated
for
before
his
translation
he
had
this
that
he
pleased
but
without
faith
impossible
to
please
for
he
that
cometh
to
god
must
believe
that
he
and
he
is
a
rewarder
of
them
that
diligently
seek
by
faith
being
warned
of
god
of
things
not
seen
as
moved
with
prepared
an
ark
to
the
saving
of
his
by
the
which
he
condemned
the
and
became
heir
of
the
righteousness
which
is
by
by
faith
when
he
was
called
to
go
out
into
a
place
which
he
should
after
receive
for
an
and
he
went
not
knowing
whither
he
by
faith
he
sojourned
in
the
land
of
as
a
strange
dwelling
in
tabernacles
with
isaac
and
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
for
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
whose
builder
and
maker
through
faith
also
sara
herself
received
strength
to
conceive
and
was
delivered
of
a
child
when
she
was
past
because
she
judged
him
faithful
who
had
therefore
sprang
there
even
of
and
him
as
good
as
as
the
stars
of
the
sky
in
and
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
shore
these
all
died
in
not
having
received
the
but
having
seen
them
afar
and
were
persuaded
of
and
embraced
and
confessed
that
they
were
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
for
they
that
say
such
things
declare
plainly
that
they
seek
a
and
if
they
had
been
mindful
of
that
from
whence
they
came
they
might
have
had
opportunity
to
have
but
now
they
desire
a
better
that
an
wherefore
god
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
by
faith
when
he
was
offered
up
and
he
that
had
received
the
promises
offered
up
his
only

it
was

thy

rather
to

ask

let
him
ask

man
unstable
in

rejoice
in

the

the
pollutions
of
the
world
through
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
and
saviour
jesus
they
are
again
entangled
and
the
latter
end
is
worse
with
them
than
the
for
it
had
been
better
for
them
not
to
have
known
the
way
of
after
they
have
known
to
turn
from
the
holy
commandment
delivered
unto
but
it
is
happened
unto
them
according
to
the
true
the
dog
turned
to
his
own
vomit
and
the
sow
that
was
washed
to
her
wallowing
in
the
chapter
this
second
i
now
write
unto
in
which
i
stir
up
your
pure
minds
by
way
of
that
ye
may
be
mindful
of
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
by
the
holy
and
of
the
commandment
of
us
the
apostles
of
the
lord
and
knowing
this
that
there
shall
come
in
the
last
days
walking
after
their
own
and
where
is
the
promise
of
his
for
since
the
fathers
fell
all
things
continue
as
from
the
beginning
of
the
for
this
they
willingly
are
ignorant
that
by
the
word
of
god
the
heavens
were
of
and
the
earth
standing
out
of
the
water
and
in
the
whereby
the
world
that
then
being
overflowed
with
but
the
heavens
and
the
which
are
by
the
same
word
are
kept
in
reserved
unto
fire
against
the
day
of
judgment
and
perdition
of
ungodly
be
not
ignorant
of
this
one
that
one
day
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
the
lord
is
not
slack
concerning
his
as
some
men
count
but
is
longsuffering
to
not
willing
that
any
should
but
that
all
should
come
to
but
the
day
of
the
lord
will
come
as
a
thief
in
the
in
the
which
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
with
a
great
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
the
earth
also
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned

all
these
things
shall
be
what
manner
ought
ye
to
be
in
holy
conversation
and
looking
for

hasting
unto
the
coming
of
the
day
of
wherein
the
heavens
being
on
fire
shall
be
and

elements
shall
melt

the
message
that
ye
heard
from
the
that
we
should
love
one
not
as
was
of
that
wicked
and
slew
his
and
wherefore
slew
he
because
his

works
were
and
his
marvel
my
if
the
world
hate

that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
because
we
love
the
he
that
loveth
not

abideth
in
whosoever
hateth
his
brother
is
a
and
ye
know
that
no
murderer
hath
eternal
life
abiding

hereby
perceive
we
the
love
because
he
laid
down
his
life
for

we
ought
to
lay
down
lives
for
the
but
whoso
hath
this
and
seeth
his
brother
have
and
shutteth
up
his
bowels
from
how
dwelleth
the
love
of
god
in
my
little
let
us
not
love
in
neither
in
but
in
deed
and
in
and
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
and
shall
assure
our
hearts
before

if
our
heart
condemn

is
greater

as
he
gave
us

the
spirit
which
he
hath
given
chapter
believe
not
every
but
try
the
spirits
whether
they

many
false
prophets
are
gone
out
into

know
ye
the
spirit
of
every
spirit

this
is
that
of
whereof
ye
have
heard
that
it
should
and
even
now
already
is
it
in
the
ye
are
of
little
and
have
overcome
because
greater
is
he
that
is
in
than
he
that

therefore
speak
they
of

every
one
that
loveth

was
manifested
the
love
of
god
toward
because
that
god
sent
his
only
begotten
son
into
the
that
we
might
live
through

is
not
that
we
loved
but
that
he
loved
and
sent
his
son
the
propitiation
for
our
if
god
so
loved
we
ought
also
to
love
one
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
if
we
love
one
god
dwelleth
in
and
his
love
is
perfected
in

know
we
that
we
dwell
in
and
he
in
because
he
hath
given
us
of
his
and
we
have
seen
and
do
testify
that
the
father
sent
the
son

shall
confess
that
jesus
is
the
son
of

love
that
god
hath
to
god
is
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
and
god
in
herein
is
our
love
made
that
we
may
have
boldness
in
the
day
of
because
as
he
so
are
we
in
this
there
is
no
fear
in
but
perfect
love
casteth
out
because
fear
hath
he
that
feareth
is
not
made
perfect
in
we
love
because
he
first
loved
if
a
man
i
love
and
hateth
his
he
is
a
for
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
how
can
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
and
this
commandment
have
we
from
that
he
who
loveth
god
love
his
brother
chapter
whosoever
believeth
that
jesus
is
the
christ
is
born
of

every
one
that
loveth
him
that
begat

him
also
that
is

this
we
know
that
we
love
the
children
of

for
this
is
the
love
of
that
we
keep
his
and
his
commandments
are
not

whatsoever
is
born
of
god
overcometh
the
and
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
our
who
is
he
that
overcometh
the
but
he
that
believeth
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
this
is
he
that
came
by
water
and
jesus
not
by
water
but
by
water
and
and
it
is
the
spirit
that
beareth
because
the
spirit
is
for
there
are
three
that
bear
record
in
the
the
and
the
holy
and
these
three
are
and
there
are
three
that
bear
witness
in
the
and
the
and
the
and
these
three
agree
in
if
we
receive
the
witness
of
the
witness
of
god
is
for
this
is
the
witness
of
god
which
he
hath
testified
of
his

that
believeth
on

the
witness
in

made
him
a
because
he
believeth
not
the
record
that
god
gave
of
his
and
this
is
the
that
god
hath
given
to
us
eternal
and
this
life
is
in
his
he
that
hath
the
son
hath
he
that
hath
not
the
son

not
these
things

the
confidence

but
he
that
is
begotten
of
god
keepeth
and
that
wicked
one
toucheth
him
we
know
that
we
are
of
and
the
whole
world
lieth
in
and
we
know
that
the
son
of
god
is
and

given
us
an
that
we
may
know

and
i
rejoiced
greatly
that
i
found
of
thy
children
walking
in
as
we
have
received
a
commandment
from
the
and
now
i
beseech
not
as
though
i
wrote
a
new
commandment
unto
but
that
which
we
had
from
the
that
we
love
one
and
this
is
that
we
walk
after
his
this
is
the
as
ye
have
heard
from
the
ye
should
walk
in
for
many
deceivers
are
entered
into
the
who
confess
not
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
this
is
a
deceiver
and
an
look
to
that
we
lose
not
those
things
which
we
have
but
that
we
receive
a
full
whosoever
and
abideth
not
in
the
doctrine
of

not
he
that
abideth
in
the
doctrine
of

the
father
and
the
if
there
come
any
unto
and
bring
not
this
receive
him
not
into
neither
bid
him
god
for
he
that
biddeth
him
god
speed
is
partaker
of
his
evil
having
many
things
to
write
unto
i
would
not
with
paper
and
but
i
trust

come
unto
and
speak
face
to
that
our
joy
may
be
the
children
of
thy
elect
sister
greet
the
third
epistle
of

chapter
the

i
love
in
the
i
wish
above
all
things
that
thou
mayest
prosper
and
be
in
even
as
thy
soul
for
i
rejoiced
when
the
brethren
came
and
testified
of
the
truth
that
is
in
even
as
thou
walkest
in
the
i
have
no
greater
joy
than
to
hear
that
my
children
walk
in
thou
doest
faithfully
whatsoever
thou
doest
to
the
and
to
which
have
borne
witness
of
thy
charity
before
the
whom
if
thou
bring
forward
on
their
journey
after
a
godly
thou
shalt
do
because
that
for
his
sake
they
went
taking
nothing
of
the
we
therefore
ought
to
receive
that
we
might
be
fellowhelpers
to
the
i
wrote
unto
the
but
who
loveth
to
have
the
preeminence
among
receiveth
us
if
i
i
will
remember
his
deeds
which
he
prating
against
us
with
malicious
and
not
content
neither
doth
he
himself
receive
the
and
forbiddeth
them
that
and
casteth
out
of
the
follow
not
that
which
is
but
that
which
is
he
that
doeth
good
is
of
but
he
that
doeth
evil
hath
not
seen
demetrius
hath
good
report
of
all
and
of
the
truth
and
we
bear
and
ye
know
that
our
record
is
i
had
many
things
to
but
i
will
not
with
ink
and
pen
write
unto
but
i
trust
i
shall
shortly
see
and
we
shall
speak
face
to
peace
to
friends
salute
greet
the
friends
by
the
general
epistle
of

the
servant
of

to
them
that
are
sanctified
by
god
the
and
preserved
in
jesus
mercy
unto
and
and
be
when
i
gave
all
diligence
to
write
unto
you
of
the
common
it
was
needful
for
me
to
write
unto
and
exhort
that
ye
should
earnestly
contend
for
the
faith
which
was
once
delivered
unto
the
for
there
are
certain
men
crept
in
who
were
before
of
old
ordained
to
this
ungodly
turning
the
grace
of
our
god
into
and
denying
the
only
lord
and
our
lord
jesus
i
will
therefore
put
you
in
though
ye
once
knew
how
that
the
having
saved
the
people
out
of
the
land
of
afterward
destroyed
them
that
believed
and
the
angels
which
kept
not
their
first
but
left
their
own
he
hath
reserved
in
everlasting
chains
under
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
even
as
sodom
and
and
the
cities
about
them
in
like
giving
themselves
over
to
and
going
after
strange
are
set
forth
for
an
suffering
the
vengeance
of
eternal
likewise
also
these
dreamers
defile
the
despise
and
speak
evil
of
yet
michael
the
when
contending
with
the
devil
he
disputed
about
the
body
of
durst
not
bring
against
him
a
railing
but
the
lord
rebuke
but
these
speak
evil
of
those
things
which
they
know
but
what
they
know
as
brute
in
those
things
they
corrupt
woe
unto
for
they
have
gone
in
the
way
of
and
ran
greedily
after
the
error
of
balaam
for
and
perished
in
the
gainsaying
of
these

in
your
feasts
of

ungodly
sinners
have
spoken
against
these
are
walking
after
their
own
and
their
mouth
speaketh
great
swelling
having
persons
in
admiration
because
of
remember
ye
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
of
the
apostles
of
our
lord
jesus
how
that
they
told
you
there
should
be
mockers
in
the
last
who
should
walk
after
their

need
no
